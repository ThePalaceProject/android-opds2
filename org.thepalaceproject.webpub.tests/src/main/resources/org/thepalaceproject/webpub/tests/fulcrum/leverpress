From the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, officials in both empires compiled large quantities of structured data on the climate, topography, natural products, languages, religions, and more of their locales, creating a vision of their empires as diverse yet unified. Through a new methodology of “juxtapositional comparison,” the book reads the \u003cem\u003edifangzhi\u003c\/em\u003e 地方志 (local gazetteers) of China and the \u003cem\u003erelaciones geográficas\u003c\/em\u003e of the Spanish world in parallel. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKnowing an Empire\u003c\/em\u003e does not see the conveyance of information across an empire as a top-down process with an active center as a knowledge-maker. Instead, it amplifies a blend of voices that speak as much to imperial bureaucracy as to the rich local and Indigenous cultures, revealing these two early modern empires as diverse polities whose equilibria were constantly rebalanced among local powers. Comprised of 18 chapters, this edited collection reflects on the historical evolution and inner structures of the imperial epistemologies, as well as the many ways historians today read \u003cem\u003edifangzhi\u003c\/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003erelaciones geográficas\u003c\/em\u003e to understand the spatial, natural, and social order in both the Chinese and the Spanish empires. At once a comparative and a connected history, it places Chinese and Spanish imperial knowledge in the globalizing early modern world, highlighting the migration of people, goods, and ideas and revealing how these wide-ranging influences are reflected—or not—in the \u003cem\u003edifangzhi\u003c\/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003erelaciones\u003c\/em\u003e.

The contributors challenge conventional binaries of Western versus Eastern, and colonial versus non-colonial, presenting a nuanced perspective of early modern empires as dynamic, interconnected entities through the shared challenges of scale, diversity, and increasing globalization. Through these dialogues, \u003cem\u003eKnowing an Empire\u003c\/em\u003e illuminates the complex entanglement of ruling and understanding.

The third section addresses how urban fantasy explores the relationship between the supernatural and modernity. Ekman offers readings of fiction by Ben Aaronovitch, Lauren Beukes, P.

With characteristic clarity and precision he presents us with his findings on the genre: for Ekman, urban fantasy brings fantastic or supernatural tropes into direct engagement with the modern (a concept he helpfully explains), giving special attention to the unseen, from marginalised communities and neglected spaces to authoritarian secret societies, criminal organizations and hidden parallel worlds. In the process, it returns repeatedly to ‘social commentary’, a focus on the politics of living among the ever-changing contradictions of modernity. After tracing the history of the genre through a range of ‘pre-urban fantasies’, Ekman demonstrates how it has gone on to transform itself through the decades by braiding into these core concerns a series of new narrative threads from other genres, each tailored to the needs and obsessions of a new generation. This ongoing process of braiding explains why there are so many different opinions current about what constitutes urban fantasy. In his coda Ekman offers a ‘short answer’ to this question; but his book presents us with a rich abundance of terms, ideas, and further questions which fans and scholars will be debating for years to come.

Stemming from a growing awareness of the complexities surrounding access to sufficient food globally, movements advocating for food justice and sovereignty have emerged in response to these systemic inequities and health disparities, particularly in local communities. With the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts in regions such as Ukraine and Gaza, and the escalating impacts of climate change, reliable food security has become exacerbated by these existing disparities. \u003cem\u003eGleanings from the Field\u003c\/em\u003e argues that addressing food security is essential for tackling broader sustainability challenges facing humanity and recognizes the role of food in community-building, cultural exchange, and quality of life.

Theater and Crisis proposes a literary and theatrical study of how Floyd\u0026#39;s killing could possibly happen in the aftermath of the Civil Rights era, and in the supposedly post-racial era following the election of Barack Obama. In the days and months following Floyd\u0026#39;s death, there were nightly protests in streets across the United States and broader world. At the same time, theater performances were forced to shift online to video conferencing platforms and to find new ways to engage audiences.

Building on the study of myth as active, processual storytelling, Rankine acknowledges that it grounds and orients groups toward significant events. Theater and Crisis aligns narratives about Emmett Till, Trayvon Martin, and George Floyd, among others, with ancient, mythic figures such as Christ, Dionysus, Oedipus, and Moses.

Gregory Brazeal’s \u003cem\u003eThe Hero and the Victim\u003c\/em\u003e situates Iraq War fiction in war literature’s broader history. In contrast to the emphasis of most pre-modern war literature on the figure of the warrior-as-hero, and the growing modern emphasis on the figure of the soldier-as-victim, Iraq War fiction reflects the troubled emergence of a new narrative: the story of the ordinary soldier as a wrongdoer or even criminal. To a greater extent than earlier literature about American wars, Iraq War fiction is haunted by depictions of moral injury and expressions of unresolved guilt. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe emphasis on soldier criminality in Iraq War fiction can be partly explained by the rise of moral cosmopolitanism and its blurring of the traditional conceptual lines between war and crime. The anti-war literature of the twentieth century often presented fallen soldiers on both sides equally as victims and viewed the distinction between heroes and villains as part of the illusion that battlefield experience strips away. Written in the long shadow of Nuremberg, Iraq War fiction grapples with the possibility that the soldiers on one’s own side may not be the heroes in the story, or even the victims, but participants in a wrong, and perhaps even complicit in crimes. \u003cem\u003eThe Hero and the Victim\u003c\/em\u003e contributes to the ongoing, public reexamination of American traditions by confronting a topic that has, up to now, been largely untouched: the moral celebration of military service. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Hero and the Victim\u003c\/em\u003e explores the theme of soldier criminality through close readings of several works by American authors, including Kevin Powers’s \u003cem\u003eThe Yellow Birds\u003c\/em\u003e, Phil Klay’s \u003cem\u003eRedeployment\u003c\/em\u003e, Helen Benedict’s \u003cem\u003eSand Queen\u003c\/em\u003e, Chris Kyle’s \u003cem\u003eAmerican Sniper\u003c\/em\u003e, and Roy Scranton’s \u003cem\u003eWar Porn\u003c\/em\u003e.

The contemporary formations of the suburban sitcom, the post-apocalyptic genre, the sci-fi dystopia, crime fiction, the superhero genre, and contemporary horror would not exist in the way they do today without the aesthetic material and racial history of Detroit. When DC Comics wanted to compete with Marvel and market “socially relevant” comics, especially ones dealing with issues of race, they swapped Gotham and Metropolis for Detroit. What about vampires concerned with de-industrialization, heritage conservation, and impending water wars? Must be Detroit. A story about a half-man, half-robot wrestling with what it means to be human by fighting crime? Improbably, Detroit has two. Author Vincent Haddad’s \u003cem\u003eThe Detroit Genre\u003c\/em\u003e provides the first comprehensive literary and cultural investigation of the representations of Detroit in popular and literary culture.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e The book first establishes the concept of the “Detroit genre” that emerged in late 1960s and traces the tropes of this white-centric narrative genre in popular culture, touching on key texts including \u003cem\u003eBlue Collar\u003c\/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRobocop\u003c\/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe Crow\u003c\/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eIt Follows\u003c\/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eBarbarian\u003c\/em\u003e.

The texts studied here condition forgetfulness about Detroit’s history or expose it to a full reckoning, direct attention toward or away from the city’s agents of injustice, fetishize resilience or model resistance, and foreclose or imagine a future of Black liberation.

The \u003cem\u003eEssentials\u003c\/em\u003e is one of the earliest Chinese anthologies designed to educate rulers in cultivating an ethical character and governing the state. Commissioned for the Tang emperor Taizong in the 620s, the \u003cem\u003eEssentials\u003c\/em\u003e articulates a distinctive political philosophy through a collection of excerpts from earlier canonical, historical, and masters writings, and their commentaries. Examining the \u003cem\u003eEssentials\u003c\/em\u003e and its transmission in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam through the lens of cultural memory, Ngo explores the foundation, conduct, and impact of Zhenguan rulership, which became synonymous with good governance among later generations of ruling elites, scholars, and historians in China and beyond. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBy connecting the textual discourse with an analysis of its use and reception across the region, Ngo demonstrates that the \u003cem\u003eEssentials\u003c\/em\u003e was a key source of Confucian political thought and practice during the early Tang dynasty. In accounting for the place of the \u003cem\u003eEssentials\u003c\/em\u003e in political advice literature, Ngo illustrates how it drew from the ancient Confucian heritage and was still responsive to contemporaneous political concerns, suggesting that the \u003cem\u003eEssentials\u003c\/em\u003e played a part in the success of Zhenguan political practice.\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOrdering Tang China\u003c\/em\u003e also includes the first English-language translations of portions of the seventh-century anthology, with reference to partial translations published in nine languages.

As a result, scholarship on his views on women have differed significantly in their conclusions, with some scholars suggesting that he is overwhelmingly positive towards women and marriage and perhaps even a “precursor to feminism,”  and others arguing that he was rather negative on the issue. \u003cem\u003eLike a Captive Bird: Gender and Virtue in Plutarch\u003c\/em\u003e is an examination of these educational methods employed in Plutarch’s work to regulate the expression of gender identity in women and men. In six chapters, author Lunette Warren analyzes Plutarch’s ideas about women and gender in \u003cem\u003eMoralia\u003c\/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eLives\u003c\/em\u003e.

Plutarch’s expression of gender is also an expression of a moral condition that signifies relationships of power, Warren claims, especially power relationships between the husband and wife. Uncovered in these texts is evidence of a redistribution of power, which allows some women to dominate other women and, in rare cases, men too. Like a Captive Bird offers a unique and fresh interpretation of Plutarch’s metaphysics which centers gender as one of the organizational principles of nature. It is aimed at scholars of Plutarch, ancient philosophy, and ancient gender studies, especially those who are interested in feminist studies of antiquity.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eReviews\u003c\/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u0026quot;[Warren] should be commended for the ambition and comprehensiveness of this monograph, which has surely moved the conversation concerning Plutarch’s views on women away from trite \u0026quot;feminist or not\u0026quot; critiques.

To a teenager, for example a “conversation” is just as likely to refer to an exchange of text messages as it is a face-to-face discussion. Meanwhile, Facebook has redefined what friendship means, Snapchat what a memory means, etc. The kinds of changes smartphones bring are happening at rapid pace: TikTok reached a billion users in just over three years, whereas it took the telephone 75 years to reach a tenth of that number of people. \u003cem\u003eMeaningful Technologies: How Digital Metaphors Change the Way We Think and Live\u003c\/em\u003e by Eric Chown and Fernando Nascimento offers systematic reconsideration of the ways in which digital technologies impact our lives both individually and collectively. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMetaphors aren’t just a clever way to describe technology, they are also changing the way we think. When we click on a picture of a shopping cart it connects a complex set of technologies to represent a simple idea that we’re all familiar with. A heart icon under a photo is understood as an easy way to express appreciation. We aren’t required to understand how technology works, just how we interact with it. The ambiguity of metaphors, and the complexity of technology can also hide important realities about what is being described. “The cloud,” for example, actually consists of very real data centers, which consume huge amounts of natural resources to keep running. Meanwhile, pressing that heart icon on a photo is a signal to the artificial intelligences running in your app that you want to see more things like that photo and that it should adjust what it knows about you accordingly.\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a constant feedback loop between us and the digital technologies we use. We are constantly using them and they are changing us through their usage. \u003cem\u003eMeaningful Technologies\u003c\/em\u003e focuses on this loop from the perspectives of hermeneutic philosophy and cognitive science. Through the former, the authors examine meaning and how it changes over time. Through the latter, they gain understanding of how this feedback loop impacts individuals, especially in terms of learning and attention. Chown and Nascimento argue that, on the one hand, apps have a kind of agency never before possible in a technology, but also that, armed with a critical framework for examining such apps, we can regain some of our own agency. This book will appeal to scholars of digital media digital and computational studies, and those interested in issues related to ethical impacts of digital technologies.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eReviews\u003c\/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u0026quot;\u003cem\u003eMeaningful Technologies\u003c\/em\u003e offers incisive insight into the pervasiveness of metaphor within digital technology—such as what it means to “like” someone on Facebook—and in turn into how these digital metaphors change human meaning and cognitive structures—for example, the nature of friendship.

To address this challenge, contributors describe various approaches to substantively, often radically, redistribute archival resources and authority. The chapters within Transforming the Authority of the Archive offer thoughtful and creative pedagogical approaches to counter the presumed neutrality of the archive and advocate a shared understanding of the contingency of archival collections. This book is a must-read for liberal arts faculty, graduate students, archivists (both community- and institutionally-affiliated), information-studies professionals, librarians, and other professionals working and teaching in archives, museums, libraries, and other cultural heritage institutions.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eAbout the editors\u003c\/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Andi Gustavson is the head of research services at the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCharlotte Nunes is director of digital scholarship services at Lafayette College Libraries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12752519\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12752519","language":"eng","modified":"2024-07-02T08:17:57Z","published":"2023-01-01","publisher":"Lever Press","subject":["EDUCATION   / Teaching Methods \u0026 Materials/Library Skills","LANGUAGE ARTS \u0026 DISCIPLINES   / Library \u0026 Information Science/Archives \u0026 Special Libraries"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/6682x674d/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/6682x674d/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/qn59q680k/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/cf95jf60s/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/cf95jf60s/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/cf95jf60s/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/cf95jf60s/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"An Asian American Theology of Liberation","author":["Wong Tian An","Wong Tian An"],"description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb\u003eOffers foundations for a new generation seeking to reconcile faith and politics without compromise\u003c\/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWhat does liberation mean for Asians at the core of an anti-Black, settler-colonial empire?

Spurred by the energy of the second wave feminist movement, they learned how to research histories buried in old books and archives and how to print on a vintage letterpress. The press attracted more participants, closing only in 1991 in response to changing communication technologies. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDrawing on feminist and material rhetorics, the authors of \u003ci\u003eWomen Making History\u003c\/i\u003e demonstrate that, by creating postcards, Helaine Victoria Press aimed to do more than provide a convenient writing surface or even affect collective memory; instead, they argue, the press \u003ci\u003egenerated feminist memory\u003c\/i\u003e. The cards, each with the picture of a woman or group of women from history, were multimodal. Pictures were framed in colors and borders appropriate to the era and subject. Lengthy captions offered details about the lives of the women pictured. Unlike other memorials, the cards were mobile; they traveled through the postal system, viewed along the way by the purchasers, mail sorters, mail carriers, and recipients. Upon arriving at their destinations, cards were often posted on office bulletin boards or refrigerators at home, where surroundings shaped their meanings. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWomen Making History\u003c\/i\u003e shows that Helaine Victoria Press’s cards, like the movement from which they emanated, were dynamic and participatory. They were, in short, a multidirectional, open ended, rhetorically evolving process of transforming feminist consciousness. The print edition includes many images from the press’s records, and the digital edition offers additional images plus audio and video clips from press participants.\u003cbr\u003e This is the first book to demonstrate the relationships between the feminist art movement, the women in print movement, and the scholars studying women’s history. Readers will be drawn to both the large quantity of illustrative materials and the theoretical framework of the book, as it provides an expanded understanding of rhetorical multimodality.

Informed by archival theory and practice, as well as a deep appreciation of Bishop’s poetics, the collection charts new territory for teaching and reading American poetry at the intersection of the institutional archive, literary study, the liberal arts college, and the digital humanities. The fifteen essays in this collection use this archive as a subject, and, for the first time, argue for the critical importance of working with and describing original documents in order to understand the relationship between this most archival of poets and her own archive. This collection features a unique set of interdisciplinary scholars, archivists, translators, and poets, who approach the archive collaboratively and from multiple perspectives. The contributions explore remarkable new acquisitions, such as Bishop’s letters to her psychoanalyst, one of the most detailed psychosexual memoirs of any twentieth century poet and the exuberant correspondence with her final partner, Alice Methfessel, an important series of queer love letters of the 20th century. Lever Press’s digital environment allows the contributors to present some of the visual experience of the archive, such as Bishop’s extraordinary “multi-medial” and “multimodal” notebooks, in order to reveal aspects of the poet’s complex composition process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11649332\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11649332","language":"eng","modified":"2023-12-12T09:19:27Z","published":"2020-01-01","publisher":"Lever Press","subject":["LITERARY CRITICISM   / Poetry","LITERARY CRITICISM   / LGBT"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/q237ht583/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/q237ht583/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/pc289m03v/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/2z10wr81b/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/2z10wr81b/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/2z10wr81b/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/2z10wr81b/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Make It New: Reshaping Jazz in the 21st Century","author":"Beuttler, Bill","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eAs jazz enters its second century it is reasserting itself as dynamic and relevant. \u003cem\u003eBoston Globe\u003c\/em\u003e jazz writer and Emerson College professor Bill Beuttler reveals new ways in which jazz is engaging with society through the vivid biographies and music of Jason Moran, Vijay Iyer, Rudresh Mahanthappa, The Bad Plus, Miguel Zenón, Anat Cohen, Robert Glasper, and Esperanza Spalding.

Whether given utility as building parts, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, or foodstuffs, whether seen by their proponents as human-made or “found in nature,” materials result from the designation of some matter as both knowable and worth knowing about. In following these determinations we learn that the production of physical novelty under industrial, imperial and other cultural conditions has historically accomplished a huge range of social effects, from accruals of status and wealth to demarcations of bodies and geographies. Among other cases, \u003cem\u003eNew Materials\u003c\/em\u003e traces the beneficent self-identity of Quaker asylum planners who devised soundless metal cell locks in the early 19th century, and the inculcation of national pride attending Taiwanese carbon-fiber bicycle parts in the 21st; the racialized labor organizations promoted by California orange breeders in the 1910s, and bureaucratized distributions of blame for deadly high-rise fires a century later. Across eras and global regions New Materials reflects circumstances not made clear when technological innovation is explained solely as a by-product of modernizing impulses or critiqued simply as a craving for profit. Whether establishing the efficacy of nano-scale pharmaceuticals or the tastiness of farmed catfish, proponents of new materials enact complex political ideologies. In highlighting their actors’ conceptions of efficiency, certainty, safety, pleasure, pain, faith and identity, the authors reveal that to produce a “new material” is invariably to preserve other things, to sustain existing values and social structures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11675425\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11675425","language":"eng","modified":"2023-12-12T09:19:16Z","published":"2020-01-01","publisher":"Lever Press","subject":"HISTORY   / General"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/z029p6844/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/z029p6844/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/w0892d29r/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/w66345665/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/w66345665/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/w66345665/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/w66345665/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Extraordinary Partnerships: How the Arts and Humanities are Transforming America","author":"Henseler, Christine","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eThis inspirative and hopeful collection demonstrates that the arts and humanities are entering a renaissance that stands to change the direction of our communities.

How does a college professor, on a daily basis, help students feel the value of liberal education and get the most from that education? We answer this question, as professors, each day in the classroom. John William Miller, a philosophy professor at Williams College from 1924–1960 and someone noted for his exceptional teaching, developed one form that this lived defense can take. Though Miller published very little while he was alive, the archives at Williams College hold unpublished notes and essays of this master teacher. In this book, Jeff Frank offers an extended commentary on one of these unpublished essays where Miller develops his thinking on liberal education. Frank refines the idea that presence is central to liberal education and offers suggestions for how professors can become an educative presence for students. The goal of this book is an invitation to other professors who value liberal education to think with Miller about how to foster their own lived defense of liberal education, each day, in their own classrooms. The tone of the book is meant to be invitational, at times even conversational, and the book concludes with some direct suggestions for how professors can live their own defense of liberal education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11567473\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11567473","language":"eng","modified":"2023-12-12T09:19:14Z","published":"2019-01-01","publisher":"Lever Press","subject":["EDUCATION   / Aims \u0026 Objectives","EDUCATION   / Higher","EDUCATION   / Philosophy, Theory \u0026 Social Aspects"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/pg15bg380/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/pg15bg380/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/vq27zq50v/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/37720f297/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/37720f297/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/37720f297/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/37720f297/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Promissory Notes: On the Literary Conditions of Debt","author":"Goodman, Robin Truth","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eThere is no doubt that the beginning of the twenty-first century was marked by crises of debt. Less well known is that literature played a historical role in defining and teaching debt to the public. \u003cem\u003ePromissory Notes: On the Literary Conditions of Debt\u003c\/em\u003e addresses how neoliberal finance has depended upon a historical linking of geopolitical inequality and financial representation that positions the so-called “Third World” as negative value, or debt. Starting with an analysis of Anthony Trollope’s novel, \u003cem\u003eThe Eustace Diamonds\u003c\/em\u003e, Goodman shows how colonized spaces came to inhabit this negative value. \u003cem\u003ePromissory Notes\u003c\/em\u003e argues that the twentieth-century continues to apply literary innovations in character, subjectivity, temporal and spatial representation to construct debt as the negative creation of value not only in reference to objects, but also houses, credit cards, students, and, in particular, “Third World” geographies, often leading to crisis. Yet, late twentieth century and early twenty-first literary texts, such as Soyinka’s \u003cem\u003eThe Road\u003c\/em\u003e and Ngugi’s \u003cem\u003eWizard of the Crow\u003c\/em\u003e, address the negative space of the indebted world also as a critique of the financial take-over of the postcolonial developmental state. Looking to situations like the Puerto Rican debt crisis, Goodman demonstrates how financial discourse is articulated through social inequalities and how literature can both expose and contest the imposition of a morality of debt as a mode of anti-democratic control. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10209707\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10209707","language":"eng","modified":"2024-07-02T08:15:21Z","published":"2018-01-01","publisher":"Lever Press","subject":["LITERARY CRITICISM   / General","LITERARY CRITICISM   / Semiotics \u0026 Theory"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/rj430528d/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/rj430528d/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/8g84mp21m/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/4m90dx34s/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/4m90dx34s/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/4m90dx34s/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/4m90dx34s/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"History without Chronology","author":"Tanaka, Stefan","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eAlthough numerous disciplines recognize multiple ways of conceptualizing time, Stefan Tanaka argues that scholars still overwhelmingly operate on chronological and linear Newtonian or classical time that emerged during the Enlightenment. This short, approachable book implores the humanities and humanistic social sciences to actively embrace the richness of different times that are evident in non-modern societies and have become common in several scientific fields throughout the twentieth century. Tanaka first offers a history of chronology by showing how the social structures built on clocks and calendars gained material expression. Tanaka then proposes that we can move away from this chronology by considering how contemporary scientific understandings of time might be adapted to reconceive the present and pasts. This opens up a conversation that allows for the possibility of other ways to know about and re-present pasts. A multiplicity of times will help us broaden the historical horizon by embracing the heterogeneity of our lives and world via rethinking the complex interaction between stability, repetition, and change. This history without chronology also allows for incorporating the affordances of digital media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11418981\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11418981","language":"eng","modified":"2023-03-28T08:31:43Z","published":"2019-01-01","publisher":"Lever Press","subject":"HISTORY   / General"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/7h149r36d/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/7h149r36d/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/db78tf143/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/b5644s85m/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/b5644s85m/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/b5644s85m/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/b5644s85m/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]}]}

This shift toward a science-based model includes the codification of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to the status of standard scientific reference, enabling mental-health practitioners to assign a tidy classification for any mental disturbance or deviation.

This book is designed to shed light on the causes and consequences of military-security crises since the end of World War I, in every region, across diverse economic and political regimes, and cultures. The primary aim of this volume is to uncover patterns of crises, conflicts and wars and thereby to contribute to the advancement of international peace and world order. \u003cbr\u003eThe culmination of more than twenty years of research by Michael Brecher and Jonathan Wilkenfeld, the book analyzes crucial themes about crisis, conflict, and war and presents systematic knowledge about more than 400 crises, thirty-one protracted conflicts and almost 900 state participants. The authors explore many aspects of conflict, including the ethnic dimension, the effect of different kinds of political regimes--notably the question whether democracies are more peaceful than authoritarian regimes, and the role of violence in crisis management. They employ both case studies and aggregate data analysis in a Unified Model of Crisis to focus on two levels of analysis--hostile interactions among states, and the behavior of decision-makers who must cope with the challenge posed by a threat to values, time pressure, and the increased likelihood that military hostilities will engulf them. \u003cbr\u003eThis book will appeal to scholars in history, political science, sociology, and economics as well as policy makers interested in the causes and effects of crises in international relations.

Since then, at least one of the US House, US Senate, and presidency has flipped party control—often with a large House or Senate seat swing—with the exception of the 2012 election. In \u003cI\u003eWaves of Discontent\u003c\/I\u003e, Jacob F. H. Smith argues that a pervasive feeling of displeasure in the American public has caused this increase in electoral volatility. \u003cBR /\u003e\u003cBR /\u003e Conducting statistical analyses of a wide array of surveys, Smith found that these feelings of displeasure translate to lower turnout among voters from the president\u0026#39;s party and a higher percentage of independents voting for the other party. Subsequently, he conducted a content analysis of \u003cI\u003eNew York Times\u003c\/I\u003e articles to look at the connection between unrest in American society and seat swings in congressional elections, even before the existence of polling. Examining the consequences of volatility in congressional elections reveals that political amateurs are more likely to win in wave years than in normal years. Based on this data, Smith presents a new theory about the policy process—the policy doom loop—in which frustration among voters at both the inability of Congress to pass policy and anger at policies that actually do pass results in even more churn in congressional elections. \u003cI\u003eWaves of Discontent\u003c\/I\u003e offers some suggestions to promote constructive policymaking efforts in Washington to reduce frustration in the electorate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12824932\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12824932","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:24:22Z","published":"2025-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":"Political Science:American Politics"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/gf06g612n/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/gf06g612n/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/xp68kk684/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/fj236558n/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/fj236558n/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/fj236558n/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/fj236558n/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Mass Performance: Systems and Citizens","author":"Jannarone, Kimberly","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cI\u003eMass Performance: Systems and Citizens\u003c\/I\u003e examines mass performance systems from the first major festival of the French Revolution through the democratic and socialist movements of the nationalizing nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Europe, to totalitarian communist and socialist regimes in the twentieth century, ending with contemporary North Korea.

Previous scholarship on the Roman family has primarily emphasized the patriarchal and nuclear structure of the Roman family, with children often represented as passive actors in a vacuum. Believing this to be an oversimplification of how the Roman family functioned, Gianni in her  study focuses on the ways in which Roman families raised children and formed long-term relationships with individuals outside of the nuclear family, such as friends, neighbors, nurses, and caretakers, who gradually became full-fledged members of the family unit. Through a wide variety of literary works, legal documents, and funerary epitaphs for children set up by their families and caregivers, Gianni borrows from modern sociological and anthropological theories to argue that children acted as catalysts or connecting nodes in the creation of fictive kinship with individuals who were not part of the biologically determined family.

Measuring Mamma\u0026#39;s Milk analyzes the medicalization of maternity through a study of breastfeeding practices over a century of changes in socioeconomic organization, family life, and health beliefs. During the pivotal interwar period in Italy, fascism changed the relationship between the state and the public and greatly tightened the state\u0026#39;s ties with medicine and science. \u0026quot;Rationalized\u0026quot; breastfeeding was at the heart of programs to reduce infant mortality rates in order to increase the size and \u0026quot;quality\u0026quot; of the population. Highly regimented feeding schedules, still practiced today, came to represent both an eternal, natural function and the conquest of fatal maternal ignorance by modern science. They also had important consequences for fertility and for maternal and child health. Through an interdisciplinary approach, Elizabeth Whitaker shows how fascism went beneath the surface to have a lasting impact on cultural beliefs and behaviors. Measuring Mamma\u0026#39;s Milk will appeal to readers interested in Italy, fascism, and the care of young children as well as to scholars in medical and cultural anthropology, European history, history of medicine, and women\u0026#39;s studies.

This empirical study, based on interviews with both farmers and laborers, covers a fifteen-year period characterized by the modernization of production. Ortiz compares three localized coffee labor markets, expanding the analysis by contrasting the strategies used by the coffee farmers in her study areas with those that farmers in other parts of the world adopt in order to cope with similar problems. Her data challenge prevalent generalizations about the consequences of agricultural modernization on laboring families by showing that management practices and contractual arrangements are ultimately molded by local conditions--cultural perceptions of a fair exchange, familial obligations and roles, availability of housing, bargaining power in the home and in the market, kin networks, and information flows--in interaction with national and global influences. Harvesting Coffee, Bargaining Wages will be of primary interest to anthropologists and sociologists, geographers, political scientists interested in explicit and implicit contract formats, and economists intrigued by the possibility of integrating social variables as contextual aspects of management strategies.

As in many non-Western cultures, Samoan understandings of the self are more sociocentric--accentuating the social roles that people play--than egocentric--emphasizing individual, interior feelings and perceptions. Yet in Samoa, as in any culture, aspects of the self that are not emphasized in cultural explanations of personhood continually reappear, and must somehow be accounted for. Jeannette Marie Mageo argues that all cultures attempt to encompass these stray experiences of the self within a discursive system. She introduces a way of charting human development through cultural discourses, which helps reveal how emotion, gender, and sexuality are constructed in Samoan society and other cultures, including our own. The second half of the book explores the effects of cultural contact and colonialization on the innermost experience of cultural subjects. With its long ethnographic record, Samoa provides a unique opportunity to consider the dialectic between historical change and personal experience, opening a perspective on the ways in which cultural history is forever leaving its fingerprints upon human lives.

What effects, however, did they have on the status, role, and image of women in Russian culture? Examining the past turbulent decade of transition to \u0026quot;democracy\u0026quot; and a market economy, Dehexing Sex traces the ways in which Russia\u0026#39;s concept of womanhood both changed and remained the same, taking into account dominant ideologies and social philosophies, sociopolitical organizations, women\u0026#39;s writings, literary criticism, film, and popular cultural forms such as pornography. The lively, engaging chapters of this book examine texts by contemporary women writers in the context of the political, social, economic, biological, psychological, and aesthetic transformations that helped define them. Goscilo reveals that the Russian cultural revolution has reshaped the female image in varied and often contradictory ways. While increased interaction with the West fostered gender awareness, it also introduced imported Western sexist practices--especially the exploitation of female bodies--formerly proscribed by a puritanical censorship. Popular magazines, newspapers, and television propagated the image of woman as mother, ornament, and sexual object, even as women\u0026#39;s fiction conceived of womanhood in complex psychological terms that undermined the gender stereotypes which had ruled Soviet thinking for more than 70 years. With the aid of feminist and cultural theory, Dehexing Sex investigates the overt and internalized misogyny that combined with the genuinely liberalizing forces unleashed by Gorbachev\u0026#39;s policy of glasnost and perestroika. It exposes Russia\u0026#39;s repressive romance with womanhood as a metaphor for nationhood and explores Russian women\u0026#39;s ironic recasting of national mythologies. \u0026quot;Impressive . . . an important contribution to Russian studies and to women\u0026#39;s studies.

In this book Klaus Lubbers examines the changing course of Dickinson criticism in America and England from the beginnings up to recent years. His study throws much light on shifting critical standards, and through its discussion of widely varying evaluations it provides a heightened understanding of her art. Lubbers shows that even during the 1890\u0026#39;s, when the first volumes were posthumously published, there were perceptive spirits who valued Emily Dickinson\u0026#39;s poetry. Among these were Mabel Loomis Todd, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and William Dean Howells. Yet American critics generally were baffled and grudging. In Great Britain the Scottish arbiter Andrew Lang was flatly hostile. As for the reading public, Higginson and Mrs. Todd felt it necessary, in editing the poems for publication, to make scores of textual changes in order to render them more acceptable to a generation accustomed to Whittier and Longfellow. It was during the creative and critical renaissance of the second decade of the twentieth century, Lubbers finds, that Emily Dickinson began to be discovered as one of the great American poets. In 1914 Harriet Monroe granted her, writes Lubbers, \u0026quot;honorary membership in the Imagist movement.\u0026quot; In the period that followed, others to take up her cause included Robert Hillyer, Herbert Gorman, Amy Lowell, Louis Untermeyer, Conrad Aiken, and Carl and Mark Van Doren. \u0026quot;Year by year,\u0026quot; Lubbers quotes Robert Hillyer, \u0026quot;the knowledge of her secret spreads, as friend whispers to friend and confides the inimitable poet to a new lover.\u0026quot; Lubbers marks the period from 1930 to the 1960\u0026#39;s as that in which Emily Dickinson\u0026#39;s reputation has been consolidated. In the 1930\u0026#39;s the New Critics, notably Allen Tate, Richard Blackmur, and Yvor Winters, contributed important insights to the understanding of her poetry. The thirties also saw the publication of George F. Whicher\u0026#39;s critical biography, This Was A Poet. In the fifties and sixties came Thomas H. Johnson\u0026#39;s critical edition of the poems and Charles R. Anderson\u0026#39;s interpretive study, Emily Dickinson\u0026#39;s Poetry: Stairway of Surprise. All these commentaries and many more are judiciously weighed in Lubbers\u0026#39; impressively documented survey. In addition, this book unravels the tangled publication history of the poems; it investigates the textual changes in editions before Johnson\u0026#39;s; and it points to the growing interest in Emily Dickinson reflected in novels and plays based on her life. Its list of more than 1,000 sources is by far the most complete Dickinson bibliography in print. Lubbers has, in short, produced a comprehensive work of scholarship that will be invaluable to students of criticism and readers of Emily Dickinson.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.13196810\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.13196810","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:24:02Z","published":"1968-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/dz010t569/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/dz010t569/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/gf06g609b/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/v405sd831/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/v405sd831/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/v405sd831/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/v405sd831/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Love... and Death: Talks on Contemporary and Perennial Themes","author":"Kaplan, Abraham","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eIn these eleven talks—originally presented as the highly acclaimed television series \u0026quot;The Worlds of Abraham Kaplan\u0026quot;—a great teacher discusses the most important questions of traditional and contemporary human experience.

Dr. Super focuses on Arnold\u0026#39;s achievement as a poet, a social political thinker, and a religious mind. He gives detailed treatment to Arnold\u0026#39;s major poetical work, Empedocles on Etna; he analyzes Arnold\u0026#39;s liberalism and contrasts it with the Utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill; and he examines Arnold\u0026#39;s approach to Christianity in a penetrating discussion of Arnold\u0026#39;s book Literature and Dogma.

The major problems concern the medium- and long-term availability of world supplies, the competitive structure of nonfuel mineral industries, and the location of world production and consumption. Special attention is given to the production of nonfuel minerals in developing countries and the role of foreign investment in Third World mineral industries. The major policy include reducing U.S. vulnerability to disruption of imports of nonfuel minerals; subsidizing, or protecting against imports, domestic producers of nonfuel minerals; conflicts between environmentalists and the mining industry; and international loans to Third World metal-producing countries. While the treatment of conflicting policy positions is objective, the author comes out on the side of unrestricted competition in world markets, including elimination of domestic subsidies to import barriers, the use of economic stockpiles to reduce vulnerability to import disruption, and maintenance of strict environmental pollution standards. The author is optimistic about the long-run outlook for mineral supplies necessary to meet world requirements for economic growth. United States domestic mineral independence may be unnecessary in terms of national security and too costly to consumers and the environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9690582\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9690582","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:24:10Z","published":"1987-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":"Economics:International Economics"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/vq27zr83m/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/vq27zr83m/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/tx31qn30d/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/z316q488p/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/z316q488p/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/z316q488p/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/z316q488p/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"China's Economic Development: The Interplay of Scarcity and Ideology","author":"Eckstein, Alexander","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eChina\u0026#39;s Economic Development: The Interplay of Scarcity and Ideology by Alexander Eckstein provides a comprehensive analysis of China\u0026#39;s economic growth and transformation from a socialist economy. Eckstein examines the unique challenges China faced in addressing its economic backwardness, such as scarcity of resources and ideological constraints, and compares its industrialization to other countries. The book explores how Maoist ideology and policy initiatives impacted the country\u0026#39;s economic strategies, leading to a fluctuating development pattern characterized by rapid expansion in the 1950s and stagnation in the 1960s. Key themes include the dichotomy between scarcity and ideology, the influence of historical factors on economic structures, and the adaptation to Soviet models. Eckstein sheds light on how China navigated its unique size, population pressures, and low per capita income, arguing that understanding these dynamics is crucial for both development theory and policy design. This volume, part of the Michigan Studies on China series, compiles essays and research that contribute to a nuanced understanding of China\u0026#39;s economic systems, with particular focus on the tensions between ideological aspirations and economic realities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.7620\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.7620","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:24:12Z","published":"1975-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Economics:International Economics","Asian Studies"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/tm70mz469/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/tm70mz469/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/fq977z15d/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/9g54xm915/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/9g54xm915/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/9g54xm915/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/9g54xm915/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Geology of Michigan","author":["Dorr, John A.","Eschman, Donald F.","Bell, Derwin"],"description":"\u003cdiv\u003eIn the eons before the first man set foot on Michigan soil, ancient mountain ranges yielded to the slow but irresistible forces of erosion and slipped beneath the waters of warm inland seas. Great rivers formed their deltas against the pounding surf, filling the seas to create endless swamps. The vast northern ice sheets scoured the face of the state, heaping high their rock debris as they withdrew to make way for the ancestral Great Lakes. Primitive man appeared here late, one of the last in the long parade of life which passes in review in Michigan\u0026#39;s fossil record. In text and illustrations, Geology of Michigan tells this fascinating story. The authors, both experienced field geologists, offer descriptions of the principal geologic features of the state, explain the origin of these features, and portray the geologic evolution of Michigan from earliest times to the present. Specific topics include the geologic time scale, the geologic eras, water and wind, petroleum and natural gas, and minerals in Michigan. General principles of geology, which may be applied to the study of other regions as well, are explained with great clarity. The authors also provide a wealth of information on the origin and identification of rock and fossil specimens. Michigan collecting localities are indicated on maps and in the text, and collecting methods are expertly described. Of particular interest to students and geologists for its bibliography and synthesis of heretofore widely scattered information, this abundantly illustrated book can be read by student and layman alike as a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating geology of Michigan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.23827\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.23827","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:24:12Z","published":"1970-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Michigan and the Great Lakes:Nature","Nature/Environment"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/f1881q25t/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/f1881q25t/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/n583xz16k/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/th83m293m/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/th83m293m/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/th83m293m/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/th83m293m/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"On the Current Situation in the Ukraine","author":["Mazlakh, Serhii","Mazlakh, Serhii","Shakhrai, Vasyl'","Shakhrai, Vasyl","Shakhrai, Vasyl","Potichnyj, Peter J.","Potichnyj, Peter","Luther, Michael M."],"description":"\u003cdiv\u003eThe struggle for national liberation, the freedom to develop an independent identity—these are the issues advocated with fiery eloquence in this absorbing political tract.

The unifying theme is that each chapter is devoted to a fresh analysis of a problem in international economics that had earlier received cogent and prescient attention by Professor Robert Stern of the University of Michigan, one of the major figures in international economic research in the second half of the twentieth century. Each chapter examines a significant issue in international trade or finance, including determinants of comparative advantage, the effects of trade restrictions and the importance of trade liberalization, aspects of international trade institutions, and monetary policy in integrated markets.  Three broad areas of international economic analysis are explored. The first part of the volume is devoted to new and sophisticated empirical analyses of important policy questions, such as technical change in trade models, how nontariff barriers are established, and how patent protection affects trade flows. The second part analyzes key areas involving international trade negotiations, including the usefulness of binding tariff commitments, regionalism versus bilateralism in trade liberalization, and strategic competition among international firms in setting negotiating agendas. The final part considers important questions in labor costs, asset pricing, and monetary union in international markets.  Professional international economists will find much worth reading in the volume.

Rooms with a View attempts to chart the development of communal concepts through the discourse of dramatic modernism, defining a coherent pattern that illustrates and anticipates innovations in modern and postmodern social theory. To clarify the commonplace notion that audiences actively participate in dramatic art, the intro-ductory chapter theorizes a performance community, which audience, actors, and other backstage actants (such as playwrights and directors) provisionally form in the theater. Connecting psychological, sociological, and aesthetic insights ranging from Freud to Kohut, from Simmel to Nancy, and from Artaud and Brecht to Arnheim and Jellicoe, Richard Barr shows how modernist thinkers are repeatedly drawn to the ideal of communion. The distinctive structure of this collective inquiry helps untangle the roots and routes of modern drama and social thought. Barr analyzes the social and aesthetic theory of four in-fluential dramatists. Ibsen and Strindberg, he claims, explore ways of acknowledging the integrity of individual viewpoints while maintaining collective coherence. Pirandello and, in more radical ways, Beckett, conclude that conflict and division are not simply inevitable but invaluable in organizing alternative perspectives. By analyzing the ways playwrights variously conceive and achieve the complicated unity called community, Rooms with a View produces the rich paradox that difference may make the most difference in creative communal consensus.

Looking critically at the work of Sarah Trimmer, Susanna Watts, Elizabeth Heyrick, Anna Sewell, and Frances Power Cobb, Moira Ferguson explores the links between Britain\u0026#39;s evolving self-definition and the debate over the humane treatment of animals. Ferguson contends that animal-advocacy writing during this period provided a means for women to register their moral outrage over national problems extending far beyond those of animal abuse, effectively allowing them to achieve a public voice as citizens.  The writers in question represent multiple genres, time frames, and political approaches. Taken together, their productive lives span more than a century. They are ideologically divided on animal protection, and their political identities range from conservative Anglican Tories to radical reformers. Through their plural discourses on animal advocacy, these women actively participated in an ongoing humanitarian struggle that forged a connection between Englishness and kindness to animals, intensifying as industry and empire advanced, and effectively linked gender with national identity and self-definition. Their concerns resonate in a global as well as a national context; cruelty to animals emerges as a metaphor for imperial predation. In this sense, the writings constitute a gendered response to an evolving colonial discourse about others.  Moira Ferguson is James E.

It focuses on three subjects that interested the great Austrian and Harvard economist, Joseph A. Schumpeter: innovation, technological change, and economic growth.  The first part of the volume treats institutions, markets, and entrepreneurs, without which analysis of the firm makes little or no sense. The second part focuses on the firm as innovator, placing heavy emphasis on the role of knowledge formation. The subjects of innovation and knowledge formation are approached from three perspectives: theoretical; industry (case) studies; and empirical (cross section and panel data) analysis. In the third part of the book the action moves from the firm to the \u0026quot;macro\u0026quot; or economy-wide level.  The volume\u0026#39;s unique feature is combining institutions, the innovative behavior of firms, and an intuitively dynamic, macroeconomic analysis, all from a Schumpeterian perspective. It is argued that the study of micro-institutions such as firms and the evolving nature of markets are necessary ingredients to understanding macro-oriented phenomena such as economic growth. It is in this sense, then, that the book is concerned with microfoundations. Contributors are Daniele Archibugi, Spyros Arvanitis, David B. Audretsch, John R.

In this well-researched study, Anthony McElligott uses an analysis of local politics to decipher the fate of the Weimar Republic. Focusing on the industrial city of Altona, McElligott locates his discussion of the contradictions of the Weimar \u0026quot;local state\u0026quot; along two axes--first, persistent financial, policy, and political conflict between the central and the local state and, second, the conflicts within the Weimar local state between the displaced and resentful middle/lower-middle class and the newly enfranchised working class.  Social Democrats used their considerable political influence at the level of local government to pursue progressive social policies, local experiments in \u0026quot;practical socialism.\u0026quot; Socialist programs, however, alienated middle and lower middle-class voters without guaranteeing the support of all workers, since the dwindling financial resources of local governments made it impossible to extend the benefits of the new social programs to many of the unskilled and poorer sections of the working class. Ultimately, the translation of the democratic republican vision into active policy provoked the conservative push for a reassertion of central authority in the state. McElligott probes beneath the level of formal, local party conflicts to reconstruct the \u0026quot;politics of everyday life\u0026quot; at the street level. This study will be of wide interest to historians and political scientists.

Based on a unique study of the decisions of Social Security judges, the book challenges the meaning of judicial impartiality. Linda G. Mills finds that, in practice, bias is a consistent dimension of what is considered \u0026quot;impartial\u0026quot; decision-making. The results reveal that impartiality as the legal system now defines it, is itself a form of bias, and that a historically and contextually sensitive definition of bias, one which takes account of the communities and cultures that come to be judged in the legal system, must overcome the modern dualistic notion of imparitality as the exclusion of bias in order to respond to needs of the diversity of applicants and the judges who adjudicate their claims. According to Mills, the judicial bias she found reflected in her study seems not only to essentialize and stereotype applicants but also prevents judges from engaging vulnerable claimants in a way that the legal process positively demands. A Penchant for Prejudice will be of interest to students and scholars of law, judicial decisionmaking, and discrimination. Linda G.

The BVI, one of Britain\u0026#39;s few remaining colonial possessions, has become an important destination point for Caribbean migrants and a center for international financial services.

Money, mobility, connections, and incentives load the political system in favor of business interests. Against the odds, when the conspicuous corporation meets the virtuous politician, business often loses in the policy struggle.  In answering this question, Neil J. Mitchell reassesses the dimensions of business power in the political system and provides a fresh consideration of how economic power translates into political power. Charles Lindbloom\u0026#39;s analysis of business power provides a point of departure for an examination of the evidence on business influence over public preferences, on the importance of business confidence to politicians, and on the financial and lobbying activities of business interests. Mitchell then considers the position of labor unions--the traditional opposition to business--in contemporary policy making. Finally, he discusses the conditions under which business power breaks down. This is accompanied by an analysis of a variety of cases in which business has attempted to influence the policy making process to test his findings.  Extensively researched, this book sheds new light on the activities of business in politics, on the strength of interests opposing business, and on business policy failures in the United States and the United Kingdom. The empirical analysis builds on survey data, extensive interviews, and archival research.  The relationship between business and government is a core topic for economists, sociologists and political scientists, taking us from heroic struggles over policy to sordid episodes of political corruption. The book will be of interest to scholars in the social sciences and in business schools as well as to the general reader interested in power and influence in representative democracies.

While some are resigned, others are desperate; a few are hopeful and forgiving, but most are frustrated and angry. In fact, fully eighty percent of the population believes that the court system should deal more harshly with criminal offenders. In this readable account, Kathlyn Taylor Gaubatz makes use of intensive interviews with Americans from varied walks of life in order to reveal the fascinating nuances in the public\u0026#39;s views on criminal justice, and in their motivations for holding these views. She questions our easy acceptance of the very existence of a public consensus around such a complex, intractable issue as crime. Why do Americans support harsh penal policies when crime rates are actually falling? How does this attitude square with our increasingly liberal social ideas? What logic is there to support stiff sentencing when the vast majority of the public acknowledges that prisons have been powerless to reduce crime in our nation to an acceptable level? The author powerfully weaves narratives from those she interviewed to construct an in-depth theory about who joins and who spurns the consensus on criminal justice. She explores the complex relationship between our political beliefs and our attitudes toward crime, revealing in some cases a telling dissonance. Through careful argumentation and demonstration, Crime in the Public Mind concludes that Americans have become harsher on crime not in spite of becoming more liberal on a variety of other social issues, but at least in part because we have done so. At a time when crime has been called the political issue of the decade, Crime in the Public Mind forces us to confront our assumptions, to sort through our fear. It gives us an opportunity to balance our desire for safety and our desire to see justice done with our innate compassion and understanding. By exposing the paradoxes of our beliefs, the author pushes us to reconsider whether incarceration really is the answer to every criminal offense and invites us to contemplate saner and perhaps more effective approaches to criminal justice. \u0026quot;In the great tradition of Robert Lane\u0026#39;s Political Ideology, Gaubatz has discovered that what the \u0026#39;common man\u0026#39; (and woman) believes about crime and punishment is more complicated than the polling numbers would allow. While clearly in sympathy with those who dissent from get-tough approaches, she offers a balanced, insightful, and timely understanding of public attitudes about criminal justice.

How have postwar peace movements shaped German political culture? Will the cultural norms that frown on the use of military force constrain foreign policy in the new, unified, Germany? In Paradoxes of Peace, Alice Holmes Cooper traces the evolution of peace movements in West Germany (1945-90) and in united Germany since 1990. Cooper examines the domestic and international constellations that gave rise to the peace movements, the sources of their multi-faceted ideologies and participants, and their organizational structures and strategies. The author then investigates the peace movement\u0026#39;s response to the challenges of the post-Cold War world.  Whereas previous work on German peace movements has concentrated on one period of mobilization or on elite security-policy debates, this comprehensive study examines all phases of mobilization since 1945, taking into account the full spectrum of actors, movement organization and strategy, and the broad political, social, and economic environments spawning peace protest. Arguing that theories of resource mobilization, changes in values, and crises of modernity are insufficient to explain peace movements, Paradoxes of Peace tailors a \u0026quot;political process\u0026quot; approach to postwar German movements. It investigates the political opportunities--the changing domestic and international constellation--which most favored peace mobilization since 1945. It examines the process through which the peace movement transformed popular consciousness and created a peace constituency. It analyzes how German peace movements gradually built an indispensable organizational infrastructure autonomous from parties and other social institutions. Cooper argues that the convergence of these factors determined the movement\u0026#39;s capacity to mobilize and have political impact and allowed these to grow over time.

Many people, including many scholars, see ethnic conflicts as a return to the past, as contests between ancient and well-defined groups with long-standing grievances and animosities. Jack David Eller argues instead that these conflicts are a defining phenomenon of the \u0026quot;new world order\u0026quot;--that they are, in many ways, modern-day inventions based only loosely on \u0026quot;traditional\u0026quot; cultures and hostilities. From Culture to Ethnicity to Conflict presents in-depth case studies on Sri Lanka, the Kurds, Rwanda and Burundi, Bosnia, and Quebec, along with two theoretical introductory chapters that offer the reader the tools to understand the relationship between \u0026quot;culture\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;tradition\u0026quot; and contemporary ethnic conflicts. Eller finds that ethnicity is not a simple instantiation of \u0026quot;traditional\u0026quot; culture, nor is conflict a simple consequence of ethnicity. Rather, each is constructed out of certain raw cultural materials, through a process of remembering, forgetting, interpreting, and inventing. Ultimately, Eller demonstrates, these groups are fighting not about culture, but with culture. No other book combines the level of analysis offered here with in-depth case studies of several important examples. It will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding these conflicts. It will be assigned reading for students and scholars of cultural diversity and ethnic conflict in anthropology, history, political science, and peace and conflict studies.

Fleming was President of the University of Michigan during the turmoil of the Vietnam era. He brought a clear and effective philosophy to the challenges he faced as manager and leader in a turbulent time. Fleming recounts the dramatic confrontations and demonstrations at Michigan over the war in Vietnam, military research in universities, the investment of university endowment funds in South African enterprises, and black student campaigns for improved conditions on campus. Robben W. Fleming has much to teach. There are lessons for all who face the challenges of leadership in this lively and readable autobiography of one who has displayed grace, style and effectiveness in difficult and sometimes threatening situations. Tempests into Rainbows also explores the influences on his life that nurtured his exceptional ability to create agreement and to solve conflict.  The story of his formative years is filled with both humor and pathos. Fleming writes about local personalities, the deaths of his \u0026quot;twin\u0026quot; brother and father, and the difficulties of the family during the economic recession of the 1920s and 1930s. Academic and athletic prowess enabled him to put himself through college and law school, emerging just in time to serve as a military government officer with troops in North Africa and Europe.  After World War II, Fleming became a specialist in labor-management relations, teaching at the University of Illinois and serving as a professional mediator and arbitrator of labor disputes. Then in 1964 he became Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and later President of the University of Michigan until 1979. Although he remains active as a consultant deploying his mediation skills, his last career position was as President of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This unusual autobiography, appealing in its honesty and in the original story it has to tell, is also instructive in showing how a thoughtful person with a humane, consistent philosophy can manage when chaos and turmoil threaten. It will thus appeal not only to those who knew Fleming and who have ties to the universities in which he served, but also to all who manage and study the management of complex institutions.  \u0026quot;Robben Fleming has written a fascinating memoir, especially his intensely personal account of the trials and terrors that faced this university president as Ann Arbor\u0026#39;s student body--and he came to grips with the civil rights revolution and the Vietnam War.\u0026quot; ---Mike Wallace  \u0026quot;To relive Robben Fleming\u0026#39;s life is to relive an American epoch. There was a time when America was at war with its enemies, and a time when America was at war with itself.

The idea of progress is brought into question by postmodern critique, attacking the notion of science as truth. Yet no other meaningful organization of humankind\u0026#39;s sense of time looms on the horizon. This volume seeks to reassess the meaning and prospects of the idea of progress. Looking toward the millennium, the volume seeks to evaluate the idea\u0026#39;s worth both in theory--is it intellectually viable and defensible today?--and practice--even if theoretically defensible, is the idea undermined in actual life? Approaching these questions from the perspectives of science, anthropology, economics, religion, political philosophy, feminism, medicine, environmental studies, and the Third World, the contributors, all distinguished scholars, provide a unique and critical balance. Ultimately, the contributors find that progress is both a fact and an illusion: it does occur in certain areas, but it does not sweep all before it as its Enlightenment votaries thought it would. This foundational idea permeates discourse in the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities and will engage historians, students of the history of science and technology, sociologists, political scientists, philosophers, literary scholars, and art critics, as well as those interested in civilization in general.

Workers, judges, and politicians divided over whether it was an unnecessary and unconstitutional program of surveillance or an effective and appropriate new weapon in the anti-drug arsenal.

An examination of the public discourse of education not only reveals the ideologies and conceptions embedded in educative acts and institutions but also provides a means of examining how education itself functions in American culture as a site of contest between ideologies, values, and the constitution of individual and nation. Margaret J. Marshall\u0026#39;s analysis employs a range of contemporary theorists from Bakhtin to Foucault and draws on a number of disciplinary perspectives, including law, history, and ethnography, where scholars have been examining discursive practices and where rhetoric is understood to be a means of examining cultural conceptions and embedded ideologies. Through these lenses she examines four influential and popular texts of the 1890s that serve to illuminate current public debates on education: Joseph Mayer Rice\u0026#39;s articles in Forum, a well-respected magazine; Matthew Arnold\u0026#39;s introduction to a government report; W. E. B. Du Bois\u0026#39;s \u0026quot;A Negro Schoolmaster in the New South;\u0026quot; and Jane Addams\u0026#39;s \u0026quot;A Function of the Social Settlement.\u0026quot; Neither a history of education nor a typical literary analysis of the texts in question, this book considers the rhetorical stance of authors, the constitution of audience and subject, and the use of references and narratives as devices of authority. Taken together, these texts reveal the complicated public discussion of education in the 1890s—a period of transformation in culture, schooling, and the organization of knowledge. Moreover, they reveal the rhetorical structure of many of the questions Americans ask about education today: who should be educated, by whom, for what purposes, using what methods or materials? What of the past should we pass on to the future, and how? Contesting Cultural Rhetorics will be useful to readers interested in the history of education and nineteenth-century popular culture, as well as those involved in current debates on education and public policy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.13953\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.13953","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:23:40Z","published":"1995-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Literary Studies:British and Irish Literatures","Education","Cultural Studies","Literary Studies:American Literature"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/xg94hs88v/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/xg94hs88v/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/jm214s024/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/jm214s01v/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/jm214s01v/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/jm214s01v/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/jm214s01v/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia: Conservatives, Bureaucracy, and the Social Question, 1815-70","author":"Beck, Hermann","belongsTo":{"series":"Social History, Popular Culture, and Politics in Germany"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003ePrussia\u0026#39;s social and political structure, institutions, and values were in many ways formative for German history after 1871. After unification Prussia accounted for roughly two-thirds of the empire\u0026#39;s size and population, but its weight within Germany was even greater because Prussia in large part molded the German identity and shaped Germany\u0026#39;s image abroad.  The Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia examines this Prussian/German identity. It investigates the complex traditions of ideas, institutions, and social policy measures that lay at the root of the conservative Prussian welfare state. The examination of the ideas and policies of Prussian officials brings out a peculiar welfare state mentality of benevolence and patriarchal concern, pervaded by authoritarian streaks, that was unique in nineteenth-century Europe. In addition, the study analyzes the historiographical implications of the question of continuity and discontinuity in German history.  The Origins of the Authoritarian Welfare State in Prussia is of interest to scholars and students of German history as well as to students of governmental social policy and of the workings of a welfare state.

For the past forty-five years, NATO has been the centerpiece of U.S.-European security relations, but some analysts now argue that the alliance can no longer survive. Should NATO states continue to rely on the NATO alliance for security?  Several theories have been advanced to help answer this question. Nevertheless, After Bipolarity defends the argument that none of them---neorealism, neoliberal institutionalism, or cybernetic theory---is an entirely convincing account of past relations among NATO states and proposes a new theory based on disparate elements of these earlier theories. The author builds his case on twenty-one instances where alliance cooperation was sought, from the Suez crisis to Operation Desert Storm, representing a variety of issue areas: arms deployments, arms control, out-of-area operations, and alliance doctrine. Much of the data for the case studies comes from interviews with government and alliance officials and sheds considerable new light on certain key alliance decisions.  After Bipolarity makes use of a variety of methods to test the key variables. Boolean algebra in particular is used to illuminate the author\u0026#39;s theory, which contends that there is no unique set of necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation but that there are alternate sets of conditions that may produce cooperative behavior. It is noteworthy that threat perception, a variable emphasized in widely accepted realist and neorealist theories, does not perform as well as other, less popular variables in explaining cooperation. Chernoff concludes that without a commonly perceived threat, continued trans-Atlantic cooperation will be possible but will require a more diligent management of intra-alliance relations.

Political Economy of U.S.-Taiwan Trade analyzes the nature of the political and economic interactions, both domestic and international, which evolved between Taiwan and the United States in a manner that has enabled this growth to occur. In analyzing the various cooperative and conflicting trade policies pursued by the two countries over the last fifty years, the authors utilize a broad political economy framework. They first describe the nature and evolution of trade between Taiwan and the United States and discuss the major economic and political groups and institutions that shape trade policies in the two countries. In doing so, the role that trade has played both in Taiwan\u0026#39;s development policies and in the international economic and political policies of the United States in the post-World War II period is analyzed. The various restrictions imposed by each country on the other\u0026#39;s exports are examined, and the efforts to reduce these trade barriers are then discussed in detail. Particular attention is given to the series of bilateral negotiations in which the United States has used its dominant economic and political power to force Taiwan to open a number of its internal markets. The book will be of interest to both economists and political scientists specializing in international economics and international political relations.

Is technology a force of emancipation or enslavement? Intellectuals such as Max Weber have prophesied that complex issues would ultimately be decided by technical experts instead of by those who were affected or their political representatives—and that politics would give way to technocracy. Technological Democracy explores the connection between environmental and democratizing concerns in Germany, to see what answers environmental groups might provide to the question of the citizen\u0026#39;s role in a technological society. The volume explores the ways in which lay citizens can participate in policy decisions of a technical nature, and whether in doing so they can repoliticize and democratize those policy areas that have become the territory of experts. Technological Democracy will be of interest to scholars and students in German history, political science, and sociology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.13881\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.13881","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:23:38Z","published":"1995-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["History","German Studies","Political Science"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/mk61rm15p/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/mk61rm15p/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/j098zf33n/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1g05fg081/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1g05fg081/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1g05fg081/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1g05fg081/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]}]}

Tracing how poems circulate through online spaces and how capitalized platforms have come to pattern the reading and writing of poetry, contributors emphasize both the expressivist cast of digital literary culture and the deep-running ambivalence that characterizes aesthetic and critical responses to platformed cultural production. The volume features chapters on Pan- African spoken word programs, Singaporean Facebook groups, decolonial hemispheric networks, and Japanese media-critical poetries as well as platforms such as Twitter/X, Instagram, and Amazon.\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThough contributors write from a variety of methodological positions and address themselves to a range of archives, they share the primary conviction that the impact of Web 2.0 on literary practice is far-reaching, far from self-evident, and far more variegated and unpredictable than easy summations of social media’s influence suggest. \u003cem\u003eExpressive Networks\u003c\/em\u003e asks after poetry’s present and future by examining what poems themselves express about the social make-up of networked platforms.\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEdited by Matthew Kilbane with contributions from Cameron Awkward-Rich, Micah Bateman, Andrew Campana, Sumita Chakraborty, Scott Challener, C.R.

Poetics, poetry writing, poetry reception, poetry criticism, and all the activities that seem adjacent to those things can be shaped, remade, narrowed, or given other dimensions not just by the fact of the Internet (which is old news) or by digital composition (arguably also old news) but by the particular layered platforms on which and amid which they stand. It matters whether a poet publishes on Instagram or by hand-coding a site. It matters who pays for a spoken-word tour and who puts the tour online and how. It matters to poetic composition whether a Facebook group devoted to that composition is locked and private or open to the public. And these matters have a history: we can do literary history with them, as well as aesthetic appreciation and detraction, criticism about criticism, media-network studies, and Marxist or sorta-of-Marxist critique. All these modes of analysis turn up in \u003cem\u003eExpressive Networks\u003c\/em\u003e, and all are used well.

This annotated, first-ever English translation presents an early queer novel long unavailable except in the original Czech. Author Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic (1871–1951) was a major cultural figure in his native Bohemia and cultivated ties with fellow artists from across Central Europe. In their extensive scholarly introduction, translator Carleton Bulkin and translation scholar Brian James Baer situate the novel within longer histories of gay literature, fascinations with the occult, and the cultural and linguistic politics of so-called peripheral European nations. They persuasively frame Karásek as a queer author and cultural disruptor in the fin de siècle Habsburg space. \u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKarasék rejected Czech translations of ancient Greek writers that bowdlerized gay themes, and he personally and vigorously defended Oscar Wilde in print, both on the grounds of artistic freedom and of private morality.

A colonized subject, a literary decadent, and a sexual outlaw, Karasék’s complex responses to his own marginalization can be traced through his fantastically strange novel trilogy \u003ci\u003eThree Magicians\u003c\/i\u003e.

The studies also contemplate how this innovative medium can enhance and supplement learning in classrooms and other formal or informal learning environments.

The authors of these chapters come from a diverse range of backgrounds at different stages of their careers, providing a broad cross section of scholastic work within the humanities and arts.

This book introduces readers to a sample of these diverse and sometimes conflicting views that also intersect with discussions of class.

Since the 2011 Syrian uprisings, El Khoury has conceived and created works about lived experiences at and across international borders in collaboration with migrants, refugees, and displaced persons as well as other artists, performers, and revolutionaries. All of El Khoury’s works cross borders: between forms of artistic practice, between artists and audiences, and between art and activism. Facilitating critical dialogue about the politics of SWANA and the impact of globalization, her performances and installations also test the boundaries of aesthetic, political, and everyday norms.

The third explores labor relations between newly emancipated Black agricultural workers and white landowners during Reconstruction. The remaining cases investigate three prominent features of the Jim Crow system: segregated schools, racially biased juries, and lynching, respectively. Throughout the century under consideration, South Carolina’s legal system obsessively drew racial lines, always to the detriment of non-white people, but it occasionally provided a public forum within which racial oppression could be challenged.

He shows that Italians played an important role in the so-called conquest of the desert, which led to Argentina\u0026#39;s economic expansion and the suppression and killing of the remaining indigenous population. Many of the texts he discusses have hardly been studied before: from Paolo Mantegazza’s real and imaginary travel narratives at the time of Italian unification to Gina Lombroso’s descriptions of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina in early 1900s. Pagano questions the apparent opposition between diaspora and empire and argues that there was a continuity between the “peaceful conquest” through spontaneous emigration envisioned by Italian liberal intellectuals at the turn of the century and the military colonialism of Italian Nationalists and Fascists. He shows that racist assumptions about Native American and “creole” cultures were present in the work of progressive authors like Edmondo de Amicis, whose writings became enormously popular in Argentina, and anarchist militants and legal scholars like Pietro Gori, who founded the first revolutionary unions in Buenos Aires while remaining dangerously attached to Cesare Lombroso’s theories of atavism and primitivism. The “growl” of Italian emigrants about to land in Argentina, found in Dino Campana’s poem Buenos Aires (1907), echoes throughout Pagano’s book, and encourages the reader to explore the apparent oxymoron of “emigration colonialism” and the role of literature and public media in the formation of our social imaginary.\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eItaly to Argentina: Travel Writing and Emigrant Colonialism\u003c\/em\u003e is a necessary point of reference for studies that address the contact between Argentina and Italy, especially migratory phenomena.

Perhaps her most iconic, generative, and expansive work, the twenty-year investigation Seeds of Change delves into the rich history and legacy of ballast flora—displaced plant seeds found in the soil used to balance shipping vessels, such as those used in the colonial maritime trade of goods and peoples between Europe, West Africa, and the Americas.

Though “survival strategy” exists as a defined gaming genre, all video games—as unique, participatory artworks—model both individual and collaborative means of survival through play. Video games offer opportunities to navigate both historical and fictional conflicts, traverse landscapes devastated by climate change or nuclear holocaust, and manage the limited resources of individuals or even whole civilizations on earth and beyond. They offer players a dizzying array of dystopian scenarios in which to build and invent, cooperate with others (through other players, NPCs, or AI) to survive another day.

In the United States, documentary filmmakers, journalists, academics, and politicians have taken note of the increasing threats to our security coming from a subculture that appears to feed on murder and brutality while being fed by a romanticism about power and capital. Carlos Alberto Sánchez uses Mexican narco-culture as a point of departure for thinking about the nature and limits of violence, culture, and personhood. \u003cem\u003eA Sense of Brutality\u003c\/em\u003e argues that violent cultural modalities, of which narco-culture is but one, call into question our understanding of “violence” as a concept. The reality of narco-violence suggests that “violence” itself is insufficient to capture it, that we need to redeploy and reconceptualize “brutality” as a concept that better captures this reality. Brutality is more than violence, other to cruelty, and distinct from horror and terror—all concepts that are normally used interchangeably with brutality, but which, as the analysis suggests, ought not to be. In narco-culture, the normalization of brutality into everyday life is a condition upon which the absolute erasure or derealization of people is made possible.\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;The study is original, bringing a wide range of voices into dialogue to present a problem that is pressing and deserving of careful analysis.

How do we relate a quantitative measure of time—months and years—to the objectives of deterring crime, punishing wrongdoers, and accomplishing justice for those touched by a criminal act? Linda Ross Meyer investigates these questions, examining the disconnect between our two basic modes of thinking about time—chronologically (seconds, minutes, hours), or phenomenologically (observing, taking note of, or being aware of the passing of time). In \u003cem\u003eSentencing in Time\u003c\/em\u003e, Meyer asks whether—in overlooking the irreconcilability of these two modes of thinking about time—we are failing to accomplish the ends we believe the criminal justice system is designed to serve. Drawing on work in philosophy, legal theory, jurisprudence, and the history of penology, Meyer explores how, rather than condemning prisoners to an experience of time bereft of meaning, we might instead make the experience of incarceration constructively meaningful—and thus better aligned with social objectives of deterring crime, reforming offenders, and restoring justice.\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;A powerful meditation on law’s impoverished conception of time at sentencing.\u0026quot; \u003cbr\u003e — \u003cb\u003eLisa Kerr\u003c\/b\u003e, \u003ci\u003eThe University of Toronto Law Journal\u003c\/i\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLinda Ross Meyer\u003c\/b\u003e is the Carmen Tortora Professor of Law at the Quinnipiac University School of Law and the author of \u003ci\u003eThe Justice of Mercy\u003c\/i\u003e (Michigan, 2010).\u003c\/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eAn auto-narrated audiobook is available via the \u0026quot;Download\u0026quot; button above.\u003c\/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10033584\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10033584","language":"eng","modified":"2024-10-09T08:20:56Z","published":"2017-01-01","publisher":"Amherst College Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/4q77ft039/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/4q77ft039/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/5x21th45z/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0p096835d/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0p096835d/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0p096835d/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0p096835d/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Intersecting Colors: Josef Albers and His Contemporaries","author":"Malloy, Vanja","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eJosef Albers (1888–1976) was an artist, teacher, and seminal thinker on the perception of color. A member of the Bauhaus who fled to the U.S. in 1933, his ideas about how the mind understands color influenced generations of students, inspired countless artists, and anticipated the findings of neuroscience in the latter half of the twentieth century. With contributions from the disciplines of art history, the intellectual and cultural significance of Gestalt psychology, and neuroscience, Intersecting Colors offers a timely reappraisal of the immense impact of Albers’s thinking, writing, teaching, and art on generations of students. It shows the formative influence on his work of non-scientific approaches to color (notably the work of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) and the emergence of Gestalt psychology in the first decades of the twentieth century. The work also shows how much of Albers’s approach to color—dismissed in its day by a scientific approach to the study and taxonomy of color driven chiefly by industrial and commercial interests—ultimately anticipated what neuroscience now reveals about how we perceive this most fundamental element of our visual experience.

The ascriptive tradition in American politics, though longstanding, has generally been kept to a relatively small minority—a minority whose rights, perhaps paradoxically, have been protected by the principles of Madisonian democracy, even though central to its worldview is the need and urgency of limiting the rights of some. It has found champions in years past in such figures as Andrew Jackson, Huey Long, Joseph McCarthy, and Pat Buchanan.

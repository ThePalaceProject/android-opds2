Jesus told his followers to watch, but do we understand everything this generation should be watching for? After all, all generations have experienced the wars, famines, and earthquakes spoken of in Matthew 24. Is there more hidden in scriptures which the End-Times generation should be specifically watching for?\n\u00a0\nAwake addresses the missing pieces of end-times prophecy, which ultimately challenges today\u2019s teachings of ancient traditional beliefs. Daniel was told to seal up words of his visions, as they would not be understood until the time of the end. He was also told, seventy weeks are decreed for his people (Israelites) and his Holy City (Jerusalem). Therefore, Daniel\u2019s 70th week pertains specifically to Israel, not the world and its inhabitants. Could our traditional perceptions regarding the books of Revelation and Daniel be amiss?\n\u00a0\nUsing a scripture-based view, Awake explores the end-times paradigm addressing foundational errors and assumptions which have misdirected the church\u2019s traditional belief system. It presents a more specific view of what Christ wants his End-Times bride to be watching for.\n\u00a0\nThis book contains God\u2019s loving message to the Ten Virgins\u2014AWAKE my return is imminent.","modified":"2025-08-27T02:04:16Z"},"links":[{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/book\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/8559c9ad-ccbc-4f93-967e-9f409845483e","type":"application\/opds-publication+json","rel":"self"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/sample\/8559c9ad-ccbc-4f93-967e-9f409845483e","type":"audio\/mpeg","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition\/sample"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/acquire\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/8559c9ad-ccbc-4f93-967e-9f409845483e\/{authentication_token}","type":"application\/audiobook+json","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition","templated":true}],"images":[{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781951310820.jpg\/thumb","type":"image\/jpeg","width":160,"height":160},{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781951310820.jpg\/public","type":"image\/jpeg","width":1280,"height":1280}]},{"metadata":{"title":"The Bridge","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Audiobook","conformsTo":"https:\/\/readium.org\/webpub-manifest\/profiles\/audiobook","duration":18798,"http:\/\/palaceproject.io\/terms\/timeTracking":true,"author":"Steven K.

A hope-filled apologetics and evangelism book written by the popular cohost of the podcast, With the Perrys. Includes a foreword by Jackie Hill Perry.**\nIn this compelling and gripping book, Preston tells the story of how God chased him. The streets of Chicago were his home, and it was there that he encountered all sorts of people who had their own versions of the truth\u2015from Jehovah Witnesses to Mormons to Hebrew Israelites. That is where Preston discovered not only the importance of the truth but how to tell the truth in a way that speaks to someone\u2019s heart. Sharing our faith is not about winning arguments; it\u2019s about winning hearts. And the way we do that is by engaging with friends, neighbors, and coworkers around us about our beliefs with truth, dignity, and respect.\nWith\u00a0_How to Tell the Truth_, you will:\n- be inspired by Preston\u2019s own incredible story about how God transformed his life forever by showing him the very heart of what it means to be a Christian;\n- be equipped with practical and easy ways to reach your friends and your neighbors with the truth of the gospel with kindness and love;\n- be challenged to respond to God\u2019s call to be bold. Eternity is at stake.\nThis book is like no other book you\u2019ve read.

Most people don\u2019t plan. We don\u2019t plan because we have never been taught HOW to plan. Without a plan it\u2019s difficult, and sometimes impossible, to achieve your goals.\n\nThe secret to accomplishing anything is to utilize bite-sized plans that move a person or organization through small steps that can be tracked on a daily and weekly basis. The smaller the steps the more likely the plan will successfully move toward the larger goal. Moreover, small plans are easy to change as you measure the success (or failure) of each smaller bite-sized step.\u00a0\n\nBefore you can plan, you need to set a goal. People often have big ideas, and fail to realize that ideas must be turned into goals first, before they can successfully see their plan come to fruition.\u00a0 Learn what a goal is, and how to set clear and attainable goals. Goals should be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time bound. Once a goal is established, no matter how big or audacious that goal is, you can then create a plan to accomplish it.\u00a0\n\nIn this course, you will learn how to set, measure and attain tiny actionable steps that successfully move you toward your MEGA goal. You\u2019ll learn about KPIs and OKRs, and learn how to best use nano meetings to keep your plans on track. You\u2019ll learn that you can achieve big ideas when you set goals and then create small, even tiny, plans that you track and measure. \u00a0\n\nNo matter how lofty your goal, learning and implementing these tried and true techniques will move you forward and help you achieve your most ambitious goals.","modified":"2025-07-15T17:39:07Z"},"links":[{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/book\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/4ef42d46-f586-4dae-9096-b77fca8145c8","type":"application\/opds-publication+json","rel":"self"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/sample\/4ef42d46-f586-4dae-9096-b77fca8145c8","type":"audio\/mpeg","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition\/sample"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/acquire\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/4ef42d46-f586-4dae-9096-b77fca8145c8\/{authentication_token}","type":"application\/audiobook+json","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition","templated":true}],"images":[{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781646895458.jpg\/thumb","type":"image\/jpeg","width":160,"height":160},{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781646895458.jpg\/public","type":"image\/jpeg","width":1280,"height":1280}]},{"metadata":{"title":"Bebe is Potty Ready!","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Audiobook","conformsTo":"https:\/\/readium.org\/webpub-manifest\/profiles\/audiobook","duration":248,"http:\/\/palaceproject.io\/terms\/timeTracking":true,"author":"Matt Ruiz-Stupi","identifier":"urn:https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/book\/MRMT000000034","audience":"children","language":"eng","publisher":"Mister Matt","published":"2023-07-08T00:00:00Z","description":"Our first story featuring Bebe!

From self-loathing isolation to a joyous community of support and rediscovered intimacy with my family.

In his self-appointed removal from society, the narrator attempts to dissect the complicated rules, both spoken and unspoken, of human interactions as well as the driving force and reason behind individual morality and universal truths.  He descends into a chaos of contradictions as he attempts to prove his own superiority and understanding of morality while simultaneously revealing his intense self-loathing and hatred for society as a whole.  While describing this distaste for the society he has removed himself from, it is also clear that he obsesses over and longs to rejoin this culture he has ruined for himself.  This work is a detailed and intellectual exploration of free will vs. determinism, moral ambiguity, existentialism, and a complicated but honest assessment of one\u2019s own soul.  To overcome truth and ascend humanity, Dostoevsky\u2019s narrator must face an attempt to rationalize the endless contradictions of life, self, and society.

A boy becomes the king's flyswatter, a seemingly unimportant job with no real prospects. Compared to today's world, where employees expect a succinct and tangible path of promotions and raises, fly-swatting seems like torture. But, with the help of a few key mentors, Ubar of ancient Babylon learns that there's more to the position than meets the eye. After all, he spends his days standing at the wise king's side, watching as he renders royal judgment on his citizens' disagreements. It's Ubar's responsibility to learn as much as possible without sacrificing his performance at swatting flies, a mundane job.\n\nThe parable of the King's Flyswatter holds up remarkably well when entwined with modern stories of people who took the skills they learned in their jobs and set off on their own paths. Modern day executives and entrepreneurs understand the importance of going above and beyond at work, forging connections, and gaining a deeper understanding of the industry, even when they hated the job.They mastered their job, their boss's job, and made themselves invaluable as employees. That hard work and dedication paid off later when they were able to pursue a lifestyle that suited their needs, financial and emotional. They gained agency once they realized that they worked for themselves, even in a monotonous job working for someone else. This is the Way of the Flyswatter.\n\nThe King's Flyswatter is a combination of an ancient parable and the author's real-life experiences as an entrepreneur, all wrapped up in actionable wisdom that working-people can use to find their own path to success. The alternating chapters about the author's own journey, and the stories of his friends and business partners, help punctuate the book with actionable principles and real-life applications.","modified":"2025-07-09T20:21:58Z"},"links":[{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/book\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/8d88577c-9dce-49b9-8e47-72a1289bba71","type":"application\/opds-publication+json","rel":"self"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/sample\/8d88577c-9dce-49b9-8e47-72a1289bba71","type":"audio\/mpeg","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition\/sample"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/acquire\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/8d88577c-9dce-49b9-8e47-72a1289bba71\/{authentication_token}","type":"application\/audiobook+json","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition","templated":true}],"images":[{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781732287280.jpg\/thumb","type":"image\/jpeg","width":160,"height":160},{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781732287280.jpg\/public","type":"image\/jpeg","width":1280,"height":1280}]},{"metadata":{"title":"The Best We've Been","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Audiobook","conformsTo":"https:\/\/readium.org\/webpub-manifest\/profiles\/audiobook","duration":38859,"http:\/\/palaceproject.io\/terms\/timeTracking":true,"author":"Beth K.

And do miracles happen today? In this warm and accessible book, Tim Chester looks at the Bible\u2019s view of the existence and purpose of miracles and gives a careful and balanced view on whether healings and other miraculous things happen today. It will help Christians to explore these questions and others regarding miracles, signs, and wonders, and know how to pray.

But often a husband's perspective and a wife's perspective on the same issue can be very different and unity in decision making can be tough. Should spouses take turns getting their way? Should they compromise? Can they avoid making decisions altogether? Dr. Harley says there's a better way--a way in which both partners get what they want and believe is best every time. In He Wins, She Wins, Dr. Harley introduces the revolutionary concept of joint agreement in marriage that keeps both husband and wife on equal footing and equally satisfied. This win-win model for negotiation starts with a simple rule: Never do anything without enthusiastic agreement between you and your spouse. Dr. Harley walks couples through the five most common sources of conflict in marriage, (friends and family, career and time management, finances, children, and sex), applying the joint agreement rule in every situation. And he teaches readers how to resolve conflicts the right way, so that not only are those conflicts resolved once and for all but the couple's love for one another actually grows and is sustained for the rest of their lives. Anyone who has been married long enough to have a disagreement will benefit from this unique new book from everyone's favorite marriage doctor.","modified":"2025-07-03T17:50:10Z"},"links":[{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/book\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/674f1211-4378-4bb2-b7c5-fc00efba35d3","type":"application\/opds-publication+json","rel":"self"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/acquire\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/674f1211-4378-4bb2-b7c5-fc00efba35d3\/{authentication_token}","type":"application\/audiobook+json","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition","templated":true}],"images":[{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781646892235.jpg\/thumb","type":"image\/jpeg","width":160,"height":160},{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781646892235.jpg\/public","type":"image\/jpeg","width":1280,"height":1280}]},{"metadata":{"title":"The Richest Man in Babylon","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Audiobook","conformsTo":"https:\/\/readium.org\/webpub-manifest\/profiles\/audiobook","duration":14238,"http:\/\/palaceproject.io\/terms\/timeTracking":true,"author":"George S.

Heiser","narrator":"Gordon Greenhill","identifier":"urn:isbn:9781683598480","language":"eng","publisher":"Lexham Press, ONE Audiobooks","published":"2024-09-03T00:00:00Z","description":"**What does the Bible\u00a0_really_\u00a0tell us about the heavenly host?**\n\nEveryone knows that angels have wings, usually carry harps, and that each of us has our own personal guardian angel, right? We all have some preconceptions about angels from movies, television shows, and other media, but you might be surprised to know that a lot of those notions aren't based on anything from the Bible. If you read Luke 1:26-38 and imagine the angel Gabriel standing before Mary with neatly folded white wings, you're not getting that picture from anything the Bible itself says.\n\nWhat the Bible really says about angels is overlooked or filtered through popular myths. This book was written to help change that. It's a book about the loyal members of God's heavenly host, and while most people associate them with the word \"angel,\" that's just one of many terms the Bible uses for supernatural beings.\n\nIn\u00a0_The Unseen Realm_,Michael Heiser opened the eyes of thousands to seeing the Bible through the supernatural worldview of the ancient world it was written in. In his latest book,\u00a0_Angels,_\u00a0Dr. Heiser reveals what the Bible really says about God's supernatural servants. Heiser focuses on loyal, holy heavenly beings because the Bible has a lot more to say about them than most people suspect. Most people presume all there is to know about angels is what has been passed on in Christian tradition, but in reality, that tradition is quite incomplete and often inaccurate.\n\n_Angels\u00a0_is not guided by traditions, stories, speculations, or myths about angels. Heiser's study is grounded in the terms the Bible itself uses to describe members of God's heavenly host; he examines the terms in their biblical context while drawing on insights from the wider context of the ancient Near Eastern world.\n\nThe Bible's view on heavenly beings begins with Old Testament terms but then moves into literature from the Second Temple period-Jewish writings from around the 5th century BC to the 1st century AD. This literature from the time between the Old Testament and the New Testament influenced the New Testament writers in significant ways. With that important background established, the book focuses on what the New Testament tells us about God's holy ones. Finally, the book reflects on common misconceptions about angels and addresses why the topic is still important and relevant for Christians today.","modified":"2025-07-03T17:46:11Z"},"links":[{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/book\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/87015ae3-8e56-45d4-af18-82add1fd7244","type":"application\/opds-publication+json","rel":"self"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/sample\/87015ae3-8e56-45d4-af18-82add1fd7244","type":"audio\/mpeg","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition\/sample"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/acquire\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/87015ae3-8e56-45d4-af18-82add1fd7244\/{authentication_token}","type":"application\/audiobook+json","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition","templated":true}],"images":[{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781683598480.jpg\/thumb","type":"image\/jpeg","width":160,"height":160},{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9781683598480.jpg\/public","type":"image\/jpeg","width":1280,"height":1280}]},{"metadata":{"title":"Are You Really Ok?","subtitle":"Getting Real About Who you Are, How You\u2019re Doing, and Why It Matters","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Audiobook","conformsTo":"https:\/\/readium.org\/webpub-manifest\/profiles\/audiobook","duration":27645,"http:\/\/palaceproject.io\/terms\/timeTracking":true,"author":"Debra Fileta","narrator":"Debra Fileta","identifier":"urn:isbn:9780736985444","audience":"adult","language":"eng","publisher":"Harvest House Publishers, ONE Audiobooks","published":"2021-04-21T00:00:00Z","description":"Just Because You\u2019re a Christian Doesn\u2019t Mean You\u2019re Healthy We tend to assume we\u2019re okay\u2014until we\u2019re not.

For this was postwar Germany, filled with starving, homeless people trying to stay alive amidst the rubble, and to the Lechows the two freezing attic rooms in Mrs. Verduz\u2019 house on Parsley Street were an unbelievable stroke of luck. No matter that every stick of furniture and even the cracked dishes were borrowed from a grudging but kind landlady, that food was so scarce they were nearly always hungry, that Matthias, loving the stars and growing things, was assigned to construction work by the Labor Office. Now that there was a roof over their heads, Joey and Andrea could attend school, and perhaps Father, if he was still alive, would find his way to them from the prison camp in Russia.\n\nIt was a makeshift arrangement at best, but somehow Mother made the cheerless rooms homelike, and soon there were good friends\u2060\u2014lovable, half wild Hans Ulrich who treasure hunted with Joey in the ruins of bombed out houses; musical Dieter; and plump, cheerful Lenchen\u2060\u2014to share their meager but merry Christmas celebration. Only shy, lonely Margret, who felt that half herself had died with her twin brother Christian in East Germany, made no special friend, unless one counted Caliph, Mrs. Verduz\u2019 cat. But eventually it was Margret\u2019s love of animals that led her to sprightly Mrs. Almut and Rowan Farm and, before the next Christmas, Matthias had exchanged his hated job for the hard but satisfying work of the farm. Margret, too, happily caring for Mrs. Almut\u2019s Great Danes, was beginning to understand the inexorable cycle of life and death, and the Ark, an old railroad car on the farm converted into a home, was ready to receive a reunited family.\n\nThe Ark paints an honest, realistic picture of the terrible aftermath of war in a defeated country. Most of all, it is the story of courage\u2060\u2014the courage of real people who, caught up in the adversity that shattered their lives, can still look at the future with hope and at the past without bitterness.","modified":"2025-07-03T17:46:03Z"},"links":[{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/book\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/d0257321-606b-424e-bd0c-a56230446e3c","type":"application\/opds-publication+json","rel":"self"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/sample\/d0257321-606b-424e-bd0c-a56230446e3c","type":"audio\/mpeg","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition\/sample"},{"href":"https:\/\/app.unlimitedlistens.com\/api\/acquire\/0bdf082d-b0b0-4135-a11f-f92bda7cc51d\/d0257321-606b-424e-bd0c-a56230446e3c\/{authentication_token}","type":"application\/audiobook+json","rel":"http:\/\/opds-spec.org\/acquisition","templated":true}],"images":[{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9798891534247.jpg\/thumb","type":"image\/jpeg","width":160,"height":160},{"href":"https:\/\/imagedelivery.net\/MoyOSb5DbIV0Ggq39kOkWQ\/cover\/images\/9798891534247.jpg\/public","type":"image\/jpeg","width":1280,"height":1280}]},{"metadata":{"title":"The First Men in the Moon","@type":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Audiobook","conformsTo":"https:\/\/readium.org\/webpub-manifest\/profiles\/audiobook","duration":29581,"http:\/\/palaceproject.io\/terms\/timeTracking":true,"author":"H.

attempts a new and dark experiment, successfully bringing life to a powerful and grotesque being.\u00a0 Shocked and appalled, his negative reaction sends the confused and now enraged creature into a quest for revenge, while simultaneously searching desperately for acceptance, knowledge, and understanding.\u00a0 Frankenstein must contend with not only the more predictable consequences of such a

On social media, in your neighborhood, at church, or in the school drop-off lane, do you push yourself to prove that you measure up . . . and then feel ashamed when you don\u2019t? Measuring yourself against others isn\u2019t healthy. And it isn\u2019t God\u2019s plan. In fact, the way of Jesus is completely upside down from this measure-up world.

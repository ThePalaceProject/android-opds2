The great Faraday Tanner, who invented the gravdrive and inspired the movement to found the moon's first independent colony, was the unequaled voice of the post-melt generation. That is, until an unimaginable tragedy cut Faraday’s legacy short.</p>\n<p>Wracked with survivor's guilt, Lane embraces her job on the moon: lunch lady—which is more than her parents think she can handle. Her boyfriend's supportive at least, when he's not drooling over one of the new recruits. Lane tries to put the past behind her, committed to enjoying her kitchen work and dating her boyfriend and their new crushes. She even participates in planning Faraday's memorial, forcing herself to grapple with monumental loss.</p>\n<p>But when colony goods go missing and vital equipment gets tampered with, Lane must band together with new and old friends to find the culprit and save her sister's dream.</p>",

        "description": "<i>My Life in Propaganda</i> is Magda Stroińska’s personal account of growing up with communist propaganda in Eastern Europe. She looks at the influence of her family history that contradicted what she was taught at school; the cognitive and emotional effects of compulsory school readings; socialist realist art and film; and Radio Free Europe and Voice of America and their role in shaping her generation’s collective view of the world. Through her chosen field of linguistics, she analyzes ways in which propagandistic language, such as ‘doubletalk,’ Orwellian ‘Newspeak,’ ‘weasel words,’ and, more colloquially, ‘bullshit,’ is used to distort reality. The book demonstrates that democracy can never be taken for granted. ",

While dreading old age with every fibre, I was at the same time in full denial that it would ever happen to me, and so, was shocked down to the soles of my feet when it did.\"</p> \n<p>In this incisive collection, Sharon Butala reflects on the ways her life has changed as she's grown old. She knows that society fails the elderly massively, and so she tackles ageism and loneliness, friendship and companionship. She writes with pointed wit and acerbic humour about dinner parties and health challenges and forgetfulness and complicated family relationships and the pandemic -- and lettuce. And she tells her story with the tremendous skill and beauty of a writer who has masterfully honed her craft over the course of her storied four-decade career.</p> \n<p>Butala gives us a book to be cherished -- an elegant and expansive look at the complexities and desires of aging and the aged, standing in stark contrast to the stereotyped, simplistic portrayals of the elderly in our culture. <i>This Strange Visible Air</i> is a true gift.</p>",

It also tells the legend of the spider and how its web catches raindrops that create the rainbow. \"The Midwife and the Spirit of Life,\" dedicated to Raymond's Granny Harriet Gladue, is about the birth of babies and bringing their spirits into the world. \"The Slingshot and the Songbird\" is about a boy's sadness over killing a friendly songbird. \"The Medicine Brothers and the Giant Birds\" is a tale told to Raymond by his uncle George Blondin about the hazards of giant animals when the world was new. There are also three stories included from Raymond's book The Tree By the Woodpile, The Tree, The Wolf, and the Mountain.",

        "description": "Writing at the top of her game, Sharon Butala returns to the short story in this astounding new collection. In Butala’s world, the season of fury and wonder is the season of old age. The stories in this book are the stories of women who have had experiences; women who have seen much of life and have felt the joy of success and the sting of shortcomings; women who hold opinions and come to conclusions about the lives they’ve lived.\n\nBut Sharon Butala gives us more — not only is each story an observation on aging, each story in Season of Fury and Wonder pays tribute to a classic work of literature that has had an impact on Butala’s writing. Among these writers are Raymond Carver, Willa Cather, Flannery O’Connor, John Cheever, James Joyce, Shirley Jackson, Anton Chekhov, Alan Sillitoe, Ernest Hemingway and Edgar Allan Poe. The result of Butala’s effort is a series of deeply felt tributes to these writers, to the creativity and their power to inspire.",

For as long as humans have been around the North, the activities of these giants have been observed in many places, but only a few people have taken the time to share their stories of coming in contact with these forest giants. In the North they have been given many regional names; although they are commonly known as Nahganne or Sasquatch. The book presents activities occurring in the North such as sightings, strange vocals, discovery of large human-liked footprints, strange animal reaction, and weird tree events. It also contains bits of history about northern North America plus details about the First Nation Peoples and their history. The majority of these unique and often hair-raising experiences were reported by Indigenous Peoples of the North including Dene, Dena, Gwich’in, Tlingit, Tutchone, Tagish, Champagne and Aishihik, Tahltan, Métis, Kwanlin Dün, and Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in.</span>",

        "description": "<span>Blackfoot storyteller Alexander Soop plunges us into a shocking well of imagination in his debut collection of short stories, </span><em>Midnight Storm Moonless Sky.</em><span> From hauntings on the Highway of Tears to fearful gatherings of ghosts and the sorrows of racism, Soop combines the social anxieties of Indigenous life with spellbinding flights and frights of speculative fiction. Through these enthralling stories of reality mixed with terror, readers get a wicked glimpse into the genre of Indigenous Horror – a combination of First Nations legends, dark fantasy, apocalyptic and paranormal enchantment, and monstrous secrets. In addition to his hungering to scare the wits out of readers, Alexander Soop also examines the overlooked matters affecting First Nations across the diverse world of Turtle Island. </span><em>Midnight Storm Moonless Sky</em><span> is Volume One in the Indigenous Horror series, a spinoff of the UpRoute Indigenous Spirit of Nature imprint.</span>",

Runningdeer then explores the energetic aspects of music healing, especially the quality of personal energies that a musician channels through her music, and how to elevate and emanate those vibrations for positive healing outcomes.",

This book explores stories that most people, residents included, likely know little about. Meet Dangerous Dan, a two-fisted brawler who fought his way into legend though countless lumber camps and booze-soaked taverns. Learn how one man’s vision and hard work transformed Bala into the “Cranberry Capital of Ontario.” Explore the history of Bigwin Inn, a lavish resort that was once the most luxurious hotel in Canada and that experienced a tragic and sad demise. Venture aboard steamships, into logging camps and elegant resorts, and through dense forests to the remains of ghost towns to unearth tales so much a part of the Muskoka experience…but overshadowed by the beautiful lakes and the endless opportunities for carefree enjoyment.",

        "description": "Niagara is rich with fascinating stories, from daredevils to heroics. From the horrors during the War of 1812, to murder, to technological innovation and the birth of the modern tourist industry, Niagara has seen it all: In 1901, Annie Taylor was the first person to go over the falls in a barrel…and survive. It is said that the former Houdini Hall of Fame was cursed by the dead escape artist himself, and that he was responsible for its demise. For two weeks in 1952, Niagara Falls shared the spotlight with another attraction, Hollywood starlet Marilyn Monroe. Maria Spelterini was the first and only woman to cross Niagara on a tightrope…and then she disappears from history. Adulterer Arthur Hoyt Day decided to rid himself of one wife by throwing her into the Niagara gorge; he paid the ultimate price for his crime. Nikola Tesla, an eccentric but brilliant inventor, tamed the falls and revolutionized electricity forever. In 1913, a barge ran aground at the precipice of the falls, creating a landmark and a tale of heroic rescue that endures to this day. And so much more…",

        "description": "<p>Pine Box Parole begins with convicted murderer Terry Fitzsimmons hanging himself in Kingston Penitentiary. Subsequent chapters delve into the killer’s background and describe the senseless killings upon which he embarks after spending years in solitary confinement. Prison lawyer John L Hill, attempts to defend Fitzsimmons by putting the blame on the prison system for creating a monster. Part II of the book contains searing stories of five of Hill’s imprisoned clients, including the, ‘natural-born killer’ Clifford Olson, and Inderjit Sigh Reyat, the only person to be convicted of the bombing Air India 182.</p><p>The foreword is by Raphael Rowe, whose career as an investigative journalist and television host was born as a result of spending 12 years in prison for crimes he did not commit. The afterword is by Keramet Reiter a professor in the Department of Criminology, Law and Society and at the School of Law at the University of California, Irvine.</p>",

Willa Van Bruggen is desperately trying to keep her family goat farm afloat, hoping against hope that the new water pipeline arrives before the bill collectors do.\n\nWilla's son, Daniel, goes to work for the pipeline corporation instead of returning to help the family business. When Daniel reveals long-concealed secrets about his grandfather's death, Willa's world truly shatters. She's losing everything she values most: her farm, her son, her understanding of the past — and even her grip on reality itself. Vividly illustrating the human cost of climate change, Watershed is a page-turner of a novel about forgiveness, adaptation, and family bonds.",

        "description": "A moving collection of poetry about navigating mid-life, full of humour and wit, from acclaimed novelist Farzana Doctor.\n\nThis debut poetry collection from acclaimed novelist Farzana Doctor is both an intimate deep dive and a humorous glance at the tumultuous decade of her forties. Through crisp and vivid language, Doctor explores mid-life breakups and dating, female genital cutting, imprints of racism and misogyny, and the oddness of sex and love, and urges us to take a second look at the ways in which human relationships are never what we expect them to be.",

        "description": "<p class=\"p1\">In <i>Know It All: Finding the Impossible Country</i> James Marsh tells of his evolution from a troubled childhood to a long career in Canadian publishing that culminated in the creation of The Canadian Encyclopedia — what one reviewer called “the intellectual equivalent of the building of the CPR.” Through friendships, curiosity, the insights of a charismatic psychiatrist, his passion for books, and the intimate encounters with the authors he met, he championed a diverse and inclusive view of Canada, which was used to draw the great minds of an impossible nation together in a common national enterprise. While exploring how memory works and how we learn to think of ourselves, <i>Know It All</i> offers insights into the intricacies of Canadian identity, the profession of book editors, and is the most comprehensive first-hand story about the creation of The Canadian Encyclopedia.</p>",

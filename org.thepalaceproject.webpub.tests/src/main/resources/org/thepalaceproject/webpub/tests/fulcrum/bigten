Lewis grew up in the Lake country of the Old Northwest and The Invasion is based on family stories she heard as a child.The Invasion displays well-researched historical accuracy, an innate understanding of and feeling for Native American culture enhanced by the author\u0026#39;s fluency in the Ojibway language, and an economy of style that is remarkable for a first novel. In 1790, John Johnston, a cultivated young Irishman, came to the far corner of the Northwest Territory to make his fortune intending to spend only a year. Instead he married Ozhah-guscoday- wayquay (The Woman of the Glade), daughter of the Ojibway chief Waub- ojeeg, and settled on the St. Mary\u0026#39;s River. Together they founded a family that was loved, respected, and famous throughout the region for honesty, fairness, and hospitality. Their home was the center of culture for the area and for every visiting traveler, Native American or white. The Invasion chronicles a time when one culture violently supplanted another even as it depicts a family that blends two cultures together. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft considered the Johnston family his most valued connection to the Native American population. He eventually married Jane Johnston, daughter of John and The Woman of the Glade, and remain close to her entire family.

The work contains a valuable discussion of Indian beliefs about spirits, traditional causes of death, mourning ceremonies, and memorials. More significant, however, is Trafzer\u0026#39;s research into heretofore unused parturition and death records from 1888-1964. In these documents, he discovers critical evidence to demonstrate how and why many reservation people died in \u0026quot;epidemics\u0026quot; of pneumonia, tuberculosis, and heart disease. Death Stalks the Yakama, takes into account many variables, including age, gender, listed causes of death, residence, and blood quantum. In addition, analyses of fetal and infant mortality rates as well as crude death rates arising from tuberculosis, pneumonia, heart disease, accidents, and other causes are presented. Trafzer argues that Native Americans living on the Yakama Reservation were, in fact, in jeopardy as a result of the \u0026quot;reservation system\u0026quot; itself. Not only did this alien and artificial culture radically alter traditional ways of life, but sanitation methods, housing, hospitals, public education, medicine, and medical personnel affiliated with the reservation system all proved inadequate, and each in its own way contributed significantly to high Yakama death rates.\u003cscribe-shadow data-crx=\"okfkdaglfjjjfefdcppliegebpoegaii\" id=\"crxjs-ext\" style=\"position: fixed; width: 0px; height: 0px; top: 0px; left: 0px; z-index: 2147483647; overflow: visible; visibility: visible;\"\u003e\u003c\/scribe-shadow\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.14321/dsyct4630\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.14321/dsyct4630","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-13T08:25:08Z","published":"1997-01-01","publisher":"Michigan State University Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/nc580q991/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/nc580q991/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/x633f463d/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/hd76s338d/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/hd76s338d/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/hd76s338d/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/hd76s338d/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"American Pentimento: The Invention of Indians and the Pursuit of Riches","author":"Seed, Patricia","belongsTo":{"series":"Indigenous North Americans"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003eAmerican Pentimento traces the history of colonization and exploitation in the Americas coming to demonstrate how contemporary native struggles are decisively limited by embedded cultural assumptions this history has incorporated into the very constitution of the Americas.

For the Native peoples of the Columbian Plateau, the arrival of whites was understood primarily as a spiritual event, calling for religious explanations. Between 1700 and 1806, Native peoples of the Columbian Plateau experienced the presence of whites indirectly through the arrival of horses, some trade goods by long-distance exchange, and epidemic diseases that decimated their population and shook their faith in their religious beliefs. Many responded by participating in the Prophet Dance movement to restore their frayed links to the spirit world. When whites arrived in the early nineteenth century, the Native peoples of the Columbian Plateau were more concerned with learning about white people\u0026#39;s religious beliefs and spiritual power than with acquiring their trade goods; trading posts were seen as windows into another world rather than sources of goods. The whites\u0026#39; strange appearance and seeming immunity to disease and the unique qualities of their goods and technologies suggested great spiritual power to the Native peoples. But disillusionment awaited: Catholic and Protestant missionaries came to teach the Native peoples about Christianity, yet these white spiritual practices failed to protect them from a new round of epidemic disease. By 1850, with their world devastatingly altered, most Plateau Indians had rejected Christianity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.5250/9781496245304\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5250/9781496245304","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-22T08:21:39Z","published":"2003-01-01","publisher":"University of Nebraska Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/k930c152c/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/k930c152c/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/n870zt84r/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x920g136r/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x920g136r/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x920g136r/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x920g136r/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians (Abridged Edition)","author":"Prucha, Francis Paul","belongsTo":{"series":"Indigenous North Americans"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003eThe Great Father was widely praised when it appeared in two volumes in 1984 and was awarded the Ray Allen Billington Prize by the Organization of American Historians.

In a narrative that is compellingly evenhanded and insightful, Donald L. Parman follows the Indians\u0026#39; continuing struggle to hold on to their land, their resources, and their identity. Focusing on the American West, Parman presents twentieth-century Indian history in the context of regional development. Two questions dominate this story: Who will control Indian resources, and who will control Indian affairs? The turning point is World War II, when Indians in considerable numbers left reservations for wartime jobs or military service, leaving a postwar legacy of migration to urban centers, a sharpened sense of racial identity, and a desire for greater tribal autonomy. These changes set the stage for such key events and trends of recent Indian history as the Red Power Movement, tribal development of resources, fights for new legislation and more favorable policies, and the entry of Indians into gambling ventures. Parman details these events and clarifies their historical significance, and he provides a useful assessment of the status of Native Americans in the West as the century comes to a close.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.2979/2047.0\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.2979/2047.0","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-08T08:22:01Z","published":"1994-01-01","publisher":"Indiana University Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/1j92gb633/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/1j92gb633/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/cf95jg023/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/k3569792v/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/k3569792v/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/k3569792v/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/k3569792v/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Encounters of the Spirit: Native Americans and European Colonial Religion","author":"Pointer, Richard W.","belongsTo":{"series":"Indigenous North Americans"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003eHistorians have long been aware that the encounter with Europeans affected all aspects of Native American life.

On Broadway stages, in Harlem nightclubs and dance halls, and within private homes sponsoring rent parties, African American performers of the 1920s and early 1930s teased the limits of white middle-class morality. Blues-singing lesbians, popularly known as \u0026quot;bulldaggers,\u0026quot; performed bawdy songs; cross-dressing men vied for the top prizes in lavish drag balls; and black and white women flaunted their sexuality in scandalous melodramas and musical revues.

They love the great outdoors and are completely in tune with the natural world. They can predict the weather by glancing at the sky, or hearing a crow cry, or somehow. Who knows exactly how? The point of the myth is that Indians are, well, special. Different from white people, but in a good way. The four young male Native American poets whose work is brought together in this startling collection would probably raise high their middle fingers in salute to this myth. These guys and \u0026quot;guys\u0026quot; they are—don\u0026#39;t buy into the myth. Their poems aren\u0026#39;t about hunting and fishing or bonding with animal spirits. Their poems are about urban decay and homelessness, about loneliness and despair, about Payday Loans and 40-ounce beers, about getting enough to eat and too much to drink. And there is nothing romantic about their poetry, either. It is written in the vernacular of mean streets: often raw and coarse and vulgar, just like the lives it describes. Sure, they write about life on the reservation. However, for the Indians in their poems, life on the reservation is a lot like life in the city, but without the traffic. These poets are sick to death of the myth. You can feel it in their poems. These poets are bound by a common attitude as well as a common heritage. All four—Joel Waters, Steve Pacheco, Luke Warm Water, and Trevino L. Brings Plenty—are Sioux, and all four identify themselves as \u0026quot;Skins\u0026quot; (as in \u0026quot;Redskins\u0026quot;).

After the Bloodbath examines this quandary, producing insights linking rampage shootings and communal responses in the United States. Diamond, who was a leading attorney in the community where the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy occurred, focuses on three well-known shootings and a fourth shooting that occurred on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in Minnesota. The book looks to the roots of Indigenous approaches to crime, identifying an institutional weakness in the Anglo judicial model, and explores adapting Indigenous practices that contribute to healing following heinous criminal behavior. Emerging from the history of Indigenous dispute resolution is a spotlight turned on to restorative justice, a subject no author has discussed to date in the context of mass shootings.

The poems, while highly personalized, reflect the tension of speakers surviving within-though never fully of-that larger culture, where lives are formed and meaning defined by their inherent separateness.

These paintings of the different lunar phases serve to organize the poems around a common image, breaking them into sections through the use of an eclipse. Additionally, the relationships indigenous communities have had with the United States-from thriving to near extinction to eventual re- emergence-are symbolized in the progression of that eclipse across the moon.

How relations between Pennsylvanians and their Native neighbors deteriorated, in only 80 years, from the idealism of Shackamaxon to the bloodthirstiness of Conestoga is the central theme of Friends and Enemies in Penn\u0026#39;s Woods. \u003cbr\u003e William Pencak and Daniel Richter have assembled some of the most talented young historians working in the field today. Their approaches and subject matter vary greatly, but all concentrate less on the mundane details of how Euro- and Indian Pennsylvanians negotiated and fought than on how people constructed and reconstructed their cultures in dialogue with others. Taken together, the essays trace the collapse of whatever potential may have existed for a Pennsylvania shared by Indians and Europeans. What remained was a racialized definition that left no room for Native people, except in reassuring memories of the justice of the Founder. \u003cbr\u003e Pennsylvania came to be a landscape utterly dominated by Euro-Americans, who managed to turn the region\u0026#39;s history not only into a story solely about themselves but a morality tale about their best (William Penn) and worst (Paxton Boys) sides. The construction of Pennsylvania on Native ground was also the construction of a racial order for the new nation.

Several selections about Trickster tales introduce traditions of humor, irony, and imagination that have come to embody native survival, liberation, and continuance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3368/144449\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3368/144449","language":"eng","modified":"2025-06-24T08:27:14Z","published":"1995-01-01","publisher":"University of Wisconsin Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/1g05fg02c/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/1g05fg02c/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/wd3760664/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p89x/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p89x/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p89x/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p89x/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Beyond the Covenant Chain: The Iroquois and Their Neighbors in Indian North America, 1600–1800","author":["Richter, Daniel","Merrell, James"],"belongsTo":{"series":"Indigenous North Americans"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003eFor centuries the Western view of the Iroquois was clouded by the myth that they were the supermen of the frontier—\u0026quot;the Romans of this Western World,\u0026quot; as De Witt Clinton called them in 1811.

On a cold winter\u0026#39;s morning more than a century ago, the U.S. Seventh Cavalry attacked and killed more than 260 Lakota men, women, and children at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota. In the aftermath, the broken, twisted bodies of the Lakota people were soon covered by a blanket of snow, as a blizzard swept through the countryside. A few days later, veteran army surgeon John Vance Lauderdale arrived for duty at the nearby Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Shocked by what he encountered, he wrote numerous letters to his closest family members detailing the events, aftermath, and daily life on the Reservation under military occupation. He also treated the wounded, both Cavalry soldiers and Lakota civilians. What distinguishes After Wounded Knee from the large body of literature already available on the massacre is Lauderdale\u0026#39;s frank appraisals of military life and a personal observation of the tragedy, untainted by self-serving reminiscence or embellished newspaper and political reports. His sense of frustration and outrage toward the military command, especially concerning the tactics used against the Lakota, is vividly apparent in this intimate view of Lauderdale\u0026#39;s life. His correspondence provides new insight into a familiar subject and was written at the height of the cultural struggle between the U.S. and Lakota people. Jerry Green\u0026#39;s careful editing of this substantial collection, part of the John Vance Lauderdale Papers in the Western Americana Collection in Yale University\u0026#39;s Beinecke Library, clarifies Lauderdale\u0026#39;s experiences at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.14321/j.ctt7ztc76\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.14321/j.ctt7ztc76","language":"eng","modified":"2025-06-21T08:21:09Z","published":"1996-01-01","publisher":"Michigan State University Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/r781wk227/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/r781wk227/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/c821gp22v/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gh93h2723/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gh93h2723/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gh93h2723/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gh93h2723/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Lakota Society","author":["Walker, James R.","DeMallie, Raymond J."],"belongsTo":{"series":"Indigenous North Americans"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003eAs agency physician on the Pine Ridge Reservation from 1896 to 1914, Dr. James R.

Since the removal of the Oneida people from New York in the 1820s to what would become Wisconsin, the Nation has been engaged in legal conflicts to retain its sovereignty and its lands. Legal scholar and former Oneida Nation senior staff attorney Rebecca M. Webster traces this history, including the Nation\u0026#39;s treaties with the US but focusing especially on its relationship with the village of Hobart, Wisconsin. Since 2003, six disputes have led to litigation between the local government and the Nation. Central to these disputes are Hobart\u0026#39;s attempts to regulate the Nation and relegate its government to the position of a common landowner, subject to municipal authority. As in so many conflicts between Indigenous nations and local municipalities, the media narrative about the Oneida Nation\u0026#39;s battle for sovereignty has been dominated by the local government\u0026#39;s standpoint. In Defense of Sovereignty offers another perspective, that of a citizen directly involved in the litigation, augmented by contributions from historians, attorneys, and a retired Nation employee. It makes an important contribution to public debates about the inherent right of Indigenous nations to continue to exist and exercise self-governance within their territories without being challenged at every turn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3368/340605\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3368/340605","language":"eng","modified":"2025-06-15T08:21:34Z","published":"2023-01-01","publisher":"University of Wisconsin Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/mg74qq57z/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/mg74qq57z/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/nk322h456/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/3j3335349/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/3j3335349/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/3j3335349/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/3j3335349/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]}]}

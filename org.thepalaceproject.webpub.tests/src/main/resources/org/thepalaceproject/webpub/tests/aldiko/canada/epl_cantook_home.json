For a place hardly anyone has heard of, her sleepy Welsh island is attracting a lot of visitors, including a conman posing as a psychic and group of archaeology students who believe they’ve unearthed evidence of a Roman temple.  Part-way through the dig, however, the students make an even more startling discovery: a body ritualistically laid out in their trench.  While intrigued by the murder, amateur sleuth Kate decides to leave this investigation to the professionals.  However, when she learns that both the island mechanic and her university friend’s son are prime suspects, she and hedonistic artist Siobhan Fitzgerald feel they have no choice but to get involved.",

In another sense, though, Robert never lost his father, whose ghostly presence lingers in the young boy’s life over the years by means of spectral “advice letters” on how to be a man. When Robert finds an old pump organ in a derelict farmhouse, he discovers a deep love of and talent for performing music. He also begins to discover secrets from his past, including his grandfather’s Communist ties, and the familial cover-up of his father’s sudden death. Along the way, Robert embraces his budding bisexuality, discovers his Métis identity and harnesses the power of his wild imagination. Recalling the work of Jamie Fitzpatrick and Greg Rhyno, <i>The Boy Who Was Saved By Jazz</i> is a coming-of-age story and meditation on belonging.",

Among them was Julius Caesar Lane, a former enslaved man whose legacy, and that of his family, is intertwined with the history of Saskatchewan’s first Black community. The settlement, anchored by Shiloh Baptist Church now a designated Provincial Heritage Property —near Maidstone, became a symbol of resilience, faith, and determination in the face of racial barriers.</p>\n<p>In this deeply personal and meticulously researched account, Leander K. Lane—descendant of Julius Caesar Lane—traces his ancestors’ steps through the tumultuous aftermath of slavery in the United States to Canada, documenting the challenges and successes they experienced in their new home.</p>\n<p>Drawing from oral histories, historical texts, and never-before-consulted archival documents, Lane vividly brings to life the untold story of the Shiloh community, from their origins in the American South to their enduring impact in Western Canada. This compelling narrative is both a heartfelt family memoir and a vital piece of Canadian history, shedding light on the rich heritage of Black prairie homesteaders and the indomitable spirit of the Shiloh People.</p>",

In her debut collection, Shannon Arntfield delves into the many ways in which the body recalls what has been done to it. Long, breathtaking sequences set within medical facilities during labour and delivery are juxtaposed with spare, lyrical reflections on ideas of memory, natural spaces, implicit love, and the relationships between parents and children. Full of precise observations, careful renderings, and visceral originality, <em>Python Love</em> is focused on how the body and mind are inextricably linked, how the past can overwhelm and inform the present, and how recovery is tied to love and connection.</p>",

Rooted in Omar Ramadan’s experiences as a son of Lebanese immigrants, and set in Canada, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates, the collection brings together intergenerational exchanges and present-day realities, from sweetened tea preparations to conversations about conflict zones to investigations of Canadian blizzards. The book speaks to Arab father-son relationships and incorporates Arabic, reflecting the hybridity of its speakers and their shifting sense of place. Resonant and intricate, <em>This Sweet Rupture</em> thoughtfully navigates cultural identity, war, memory, and family.</p>",

Diversity enriches the experience of children and educators alike in these environments, but it can also present challenges in supporting each child’s growth and learning.</p><p>In <i>Introduction to Early Childhood Learning and Care</i>, early learning specialists Carole Massing and Mary Lynne Matheson present an intercultural perspective as a foundation of equitable outcomes in early childhood education, but just what does that look like? An intercultural approach involves the respectful exchange of ideas between people from diverse backgrounds, leading to mutual trust and deeper relationships. Guided by a diverse team of reviewers, this book examines the concepts, approaches, and strategies that every early childhood educator needs to know to provide sensitive, culturally responsive care for children and their families.</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul><li>The theoretical bases for an intercultural approach to early childhood education and care</li><li>The factors that impact a child’s physical, cognitive, social, and emotional development</li><li>How to create environments that enhance children’s wellbeing and affirm their identity</li><li>How to support children’s creativity, literacy, and inquiry skills through an intercultural lens</li><li>The skills, responsibilities, and challenges of working as an early childhood educator</li></ul>",

Psychology graduate training and continuing education programs often focus mainly on common ethical issues and mainstream psychological services and settings. Although this provides a wealth of valuable information, it also necessary to look beyond the usual and mainstream. </p>\n<p><em>Ethics in Action</em> brings together thirty-four psychologists and eight collaborating professionals from allied disciplines, including nursing, social work, emergency services, and veterinary medicine, to share wisdom gained from facing ethical questions in real-world practice. These knowledgeable contributors share their experiences working with new Canadians, religious minorities, Indigenous communities, and more. They address issues of self-care, teamwork, collaboration, and interprofessional practice. They share the challenges that can arise when working within long-term care facilities, rural settings, equine-therapy settings, academia, and with people in unique circumstances.</p>\n<p>Structured around the four ethical principles that form the <em>Canadian Code of Ethics for Psychologists</em>, this book goes far beyond the basics, building awareness of the many complex and varied ethical issues practitioners may face. Each chapter includes reflection questions, challenging readers to better understand themselves and to prepare them to respond to complicated situations from an ethical perspective. </p>",

Author Troy Nahumko has lived in the old town of Cáceres, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, for over a decade. His journey starts at the Cave of Maltravieso, where prehistoric art stirs a profound curiosity about the city's rich tapestry of past and present. Amid the dazzle of cobbled medieval streets, 12th century Moorish walls, fortified palaces, and 60,000-year-old handprints, Nahumko asks how locals characterize their city and leave their own marks. Through personal narrative and interviews with locals, expats, and experts, he shares sociological, archaeological, and historical insights. Nahumko's storytelling paints a vivid and empathetic portrait of the people and heritage of this lesser-known province of Spain, as he surveys its history, cuisine, and stunning natural beauty.</p>",

When their mother is accused of hoarding and summarily killed, Nadia and Taras must leave their home on a desperate quest for survival.</p>\n<p>Attempting to navigate a closed country, to stay together, and to stay alive, Nadia and Taras must face secret police, soldiers, and fellow citizens forced to abandon charity and sometimes even humanity in the face of impossible hunger. Unsure who to trust and unable to find refuge, they search for somewhere, anywhere, where they can be safe. </p>\n<p>Historical fiction at its finest, <em>Five Stalks of Grain</em> is powerfully written and beautifully illustrated, drawing on Ukrainian artistic traditions to tell a story of loss, grief, and hardship with delicate strength. It is a record of a time of profound suffering and a reckoning with the human cost of a tragedy shaped by politics and policy.</p>",

Here are no tidy tales of aurora borealis and adventures in snow. For Dawn Macdonald, the North is not an escape, a pathway to enlightenment, or a lifestyle choice. It’s a messy, beautiful, and painful point of origin. People from the North see the North differently and want to tell their own stories in their own way, including about their experiences growing up on the land, getting an education, and struggling to find jobs and opportunities. Expertly balancing lyric reflection and ferocious realism, Macdonald busts up the cultural myths of self-interest and superiority that have long dominated conversations about both Northern spaces and working-class identities.</p>",

As a field of academic inquiry it provides deep insights into the ways individuals and collectives can work within societies to prevent disease and promote health and health equity. Public health is a broad, intersectoral, and interdisciplinary field of scholarship, activism, policy, and practice with the potential to create and support immense change. </p>\n<p>This is a story of one hundred years of public health in Alberta. Drawing on extensive research, including interviews with members of Alberta’s public health communities, <em>A History of Public Health in Alberta, 1919-2019</em> considers institutions, sectors, populations, and activities that constitute the study and practice of public health. It offers a consolidated narrative from a contemporary perspective, paying particular attention to significant and entrenched social inequities of health and their determinants, the emergence of new public health concerns, and communities of public health, including activists, practitioners, scholars, and the public itself. </p>\n<p><em>A History of Public Health in Alberta, 1919-2019</em> draws together the threads of public health policy, practice, and research, mapping its contours and presenting a holistic view of public health in the province over time. Prompted by the concern, and the experience, that public health is frequently deeply misunderstood, this book articulates a history of the field and practice essential to understanding how we may best mobilize to support well-being and health equity across populations.</p>",

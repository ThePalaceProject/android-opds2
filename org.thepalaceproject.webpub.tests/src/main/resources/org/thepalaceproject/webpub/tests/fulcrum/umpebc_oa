This book is designed to shed light on the causes and consequences of military-security crises since the end of World War I, in every region, across diverse economic and political regimes, and cultures. The primary aim of this volume is to uncover patterns of crises, conflicts and wars and thereby to contribute to the advancement of international peace and world order. \u003cbr\u003eThe culmination of more than twenty years of research by Michael Brecher and Jonathan Wilkenfeld, the book analyzes crucial themes about crisis, conflict, and war and presents systematic knowledge about more than 400 crises, thirty-one protracted conflicts and almost 900 state participants. The authors explore many aspects of conflict, including the ethnic dimension, the effect of different kinds of political regimes--notably the question whether democracies are more peaceful than authoritarian regimes, and the role of violence in crisis management. They employ both case studies and aggregate data analysis in a Unified Model of Crisis to focus on two levels of analysis--hostile interactions among states, and the behavior of decision-makers who must cope with the challenge posed by a threat to values, time pressure, and the increased likelihood that military hostilities will engulf them. \u003cbr\u003eThis book will appeal to scholars in history, political science, sociology, and economics as well as policy makers interested in the causes and effects of crises in international relations. The rich data sets will serve researchers for years to come as they probe additional aspects of crisis, conflict and war in international relations. \u003cbr\u003eMichael Brecher is R. B.

Since then, at least one of the US House, US Senate, and presidency has flipped party control—often with a large House or Senate seat swing—with the exception of the 2012 election. In \u003cI\u003eWaves of Discontent\u003c\/I\u003e, Jacob F. H. Smith argues that a pervasive feeling of displeasure in the American public has caused this increase in electoral volatility. \u003cBR /\u003e\u003cBR /\u003e Conducting statistical analyses of a wide array of surveys, Smith found that these feelings of displeasure translate to lower turnout among voters from the president\u0026#39;s party and a higher percentage of independents voting for the other party. Subsequently, he conducted a content analysis of \u003cI\u003eNew York Times\u003c\/I\u003e articles to look at the connection between unrest in American society and seat swings in congressional elections, even before the existence of polling. Examining the consequences of volatility in congressional elections reveals that political amateurs are more likely to win in wave years than in normal years.

Previous scholarship on the Roman family has primarily emphasized the patriarchal and nuclear structure of the Roman family, with children often represented as passive actors in a vacuum. Believing this to be an oversimplification of how the Roman family functioned, Gianni in her  study focuses on the ways in which Roman families raised children and formed long-term relationships with individuals outside of the nuclear family, such as friends, neighbors, nurses, and caretakers, who gradually became full-fledged members of the family unit. Through a wide variety of literary works, legal documents, and funerary epitaphs for children set up by their families and caregivers, Gianni borrows from modern sociological and anthropological theories to argue that children acted as catalysts or connecting nodes in the creation of fictive kinship with individuals who were not part of the biologically determined family. In addition to illuminating the roles and experiences of these figures, \u003cI\u003eAll in the Family\u003c\/I\u003e reveals how this social network was integrated into the family both in practice and in ideology, presenting a more complex view of the Roman family than the traditional nuclear structure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12705608\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12705608","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-16T08:24:14Z","published":"2025-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Classical Studies:Roman","Anthropology:Cultural Anthropology","History:Historical Methods and Theory"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/ww72bf691/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/ww72bf691/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/000003050/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/t435gh29k/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/t435gh29k/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/t435gh29k/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/t435gh29k/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Mountain Wolf Woman, Sister of Crashing Thunder: The Autobiography of a Winnebago Indian","author":"Lurie, Nancy Oestreich","belongsTo":{"series":"Ann Arbor Paperbacks"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cP\u003e From pony to airplane, from medicine dance to Christian worship, \u003cI\u003eMountain Wolf Woman, Sister of Crashing Thunder\u003c\/I\u003e is the life story of a Winnebago woman, told in her own words to her adopted kinswoman, Nancy Lurie.

Subsequently, Titiev made return trips to Old Oraibi over a period of four decades, observing both the changes in the individual lives of those he had known and the signs of cultural change in the community. This fascinating diary of his extended 1933-34 visit - now published for the first time, and incorporating the observations made during the author\u0026#39;s many subsequent stays - thus stands as a unique and irreplaceable record of Hopi life, and a rare longitudinal study of sociocultural change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.5774110\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.5774110","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-13T08:25:41Z","published":"1972-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press"},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/ww72bf58h/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/ww72bf58h/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/6t053k38h/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1544bs29s/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1544bs29s/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1544bs29s/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/1544bs29s/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Language and Art in the Navajo Universe","author":"Witherspoon, Gary","description":"\u003cdiv\u003eThis is a complex and theoretical study on the roles of language and art in Navajo culture, resulting from nearly a decade of research on the Navajo reservation. The structures of Navajo thought, language, speech, and knowledge are used to frame discussions on a number of topics. Primary among these from a cosmological perspective are the concepts of inner and outer forms in the duality on nature coupled with static and dynamic concepts of motion. Also explored is the importance of language in ritual control and perceptions of action, causality, and plurality. Two terms essential to the Navajo ethos are semantically explored as organizing principles. The first is the concept of k\u0026#39;T which finds its primary expression in the patterning of kin relationships and solidarity. The second is h=zh=, which is most easily glossed as representing Navajo ideals of harmony and order. Art examples, represented by music, sand painting, and weaving, are used to demonstrate how these complex semantic and cosmological considerations find their way into Navajo daily ritual life. Information is also included on color classification, numerology, mythology, ethnophysocology, and taxonomies. The conclusions expand the data into summary statements of Navajo ethos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9705\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.9705","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-13T08:25:40Z","published":"1977-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Native American Studies","Anthropology"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/1v53k164c/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/1v53k164c/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/js956k04d/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p88n/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p88n/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p88n/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/s1784p88n/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Indian Names in Michigan","author":"Vogel, Virgil J.","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cI\u003eIndian Names in Michigan\u003c\/I\u003e traces the origin of hundreds of place-names given to counties, towns, lakes, rivers, and topographical features of the Great Lakes State.

In the policy dispute over the apportionment of scarce resources, some argue that only government control or private ownership will prevent the destruction of limited common resources. The author shows how cooperation among interested parties can produce a workable system for self-management of common resources. Through the detailed study of the management of fisheries in the Northwest the author tests theories explaining the basis of collective action and social cooperation, an area of rich theoretical speculation in political science, law, economics and sociology. At the same time, her findings have important implications for policy makers who are interested in efficient and effective schemes of resource control that avoid the problems caused by regulation by remote government officials or private control.\u003cbr\u003eThis book will appeal to policy makers concerned with the management of natural resources as well as to economists, political scientists, and sociologists concerned with collective action problems.\u003cbr\u003eSara Singleton is Assistant Professor of Political Science, Tulane University.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.14466\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.14466","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-03T08:20:36Z","published":"1999-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Political Science:American Politics","Political Science:Political Economy","Economics:Micro Economics","Economics:System -- Development"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/3n204219f/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/3n204219f/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/44558h32c/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/6682x715f/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/6682x715f/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/6682x715f/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/6682x715f/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Crashing Thunder: The Autobiography of an American Indian","author":"Radin, Paul","belongsTo":{"series":"Ann Arbor Paperbacks"},"description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cDIV\u003e Paul Radin, one of America\u0026#39;s first and most reputable professional anthropologists, lived among the Winnebago Indians for years, and for years he tried without success to interview the notorious younger son of the Blow Snake family, the Crashing Thunder of this book.

The challenges Indians faced during this period could not have been greater. By century\u0026#39;s end, settlers, frontier developers, and federal bureaucrats possessed not only economic and political power but also the bulk of the region\u0026#39;s resources. It is little wonder that policymakers in Washington and Ottawa alike anticipated the disappearance of distinctive Indian communities within a single generation. However, these predictions have proved false as Great Lakes Indian communities, though assaulted on both sides of the international border to this day, have survived. Danziger\u0026#39;s lively and insightful book documents the story of these Great Lakes Indians---a study not of victimization but of how Aboriginal communities and their leaders have determined their own destinies and preserved core values, lands, and identities against all odds and despite ongoing marginalization. \u003c\/P\u003e\u003cP\u003e Utilizing eyewitness accounts from the 1800s and an innovative, cross-national approach, Danziger explores not only how Native Americans adapted to their new circumstances---including attempts at horse and plow agriculture, the impact of reservation allotment, and the response to Christian evangelists---but also the ways in which the astute and resourceful Great Lakes chiefs, councils, and clan mothers fought to protect their homeland and preserve the identity of their people. Through their efforts, dreams of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination as well as the historic right to unimpeded border crossings---from one end of the Great Lakes basin to the other---were kept alive. \u003c\/P\u003e\u003cP\u003e Photo of girls at Lac du Flambeau School courtesy Wisconsin Historical Society, image 55938; photo of Ojibwa farm family at Garden River Reservation courtesy Archives of Ontario, image S 16361. \u003c\/P\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10914\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.10914","language":"eng","modified":"2025-08-13T08:25:22Z","published":"2009-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Native American Studies","Michigan and the Great Lakes:Race and Ethnicity","Michigan and the Great Lakes:History","American Studies"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/ng451m492/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/ng451m492/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/vt150n42r/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0z709073q/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0z709073q/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0z709073q/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/0z709073q/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"Faith in Paper: The Ethnohistory and Litigation of Upper Great Lakes Indian Treaties","author":"Cleland, Charles E.","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cDIV\u003e\u003cDIV\u003e\u003cDIV\u003e\u003cI\u003eFaith in Paper\u003c\/I\u003e is about the reinstitution of Indian treaty rights in the Upper Great Lakes region during the last quarter of the 20th century.

Why, when, and how supporters of these movements mobilize offline and online to bring down democracy are some of the key questions that Sinpeng answers. While the book primarily uses a qualitative methodological approach, it also uses several quantitative tools to analyze social media data in the later chapters. This is one of few studies in the field of regime transition that focuses on antidemocratic mobilization and takes the role of social media seriously.\u003c\/P\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11666233\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.11666233","language":"eng","modified":"2025-07-22T08:22:46Z","published":"2021-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["Asian Studies:South/Southeast Asia","Political Science"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/bn9998931/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/bn9998931/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/th83m1789/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x633f325s/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x633f325s/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x633f325s/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/x633f325s/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]},{"metadata":{"@type":"http://schema.org/EBook","title":"The Most Noble of People: Religious, Ethnic, and Gender Identity in Muslim Spain","author":"Coope, Jessica","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cDIV\u003e\u003cI\u003eThe Most Noble of People\u003c\/I\u003e presents a nuanced look at questions of identity in Muslim Spain under the Umayyads, an Arab dynasty that ruled from 756 to 1031.

The book goes on to discuss what it meant to be a Jew or Christian in Spain under Islamic rule, and the degree to which non-Muslims were full participants in society. Following this is a consideration of gender identity as defined by Islamic law and by less normative sources like literature and mystical texts. It concludes by focusing on internal rebellions against the government of Muslim Spain, particularly the conflicts between Muslims who were ethnically Arab and those who were Berber or native Iberian, pointing to the limits of Muslim solidarity.\u003cBR /\u003e\u003cBR /\u003e Drawn from an unusually broad array of sources—including legal texts, religious polemic, chronicles, mystical texts, prose literature, and poetry, in both Arabic and Latin—many of Coope's illustrations of life in al-Andalus also reflect something of the larger medieval world.

The book thus moves beyond accounts that have tended to view the pre-war \"Popular Front\" through tropes of national belonging or an abandonment of the cosmopolitanism of previous decades.

Markus Kröger addresses resistance strategies to extractivism and tracks their success, or lack thereof, through a comparison of peaceful and armed resource conflicts, explaining how different means of resistance arise. Using the distinctly different contexts and political systems of Brazil and India highlights the importance of local context for resistance. For example, if there is an armed conflict at a planned mining site, how does this influence the possibility to use peaceful resistance strategies? To answer such questions, Kröger assesses the inter-relations of contentious, electoral, institutional, judicial, and private politics that surround conflicts and interactions, offering a new theoretical framework of \u0026quot;investment politics\u0026quot; that can be applied generally by scholars and students of social movements, environmental studies, and political economy, and even more broadly in Social Scientific and Environmental Policy research.\u003cBR /\u003e\u003cBR /\u003e By drawing on a detailed field research and other sources, this book explains precisely which resistance strategies are able to influence both political and economic outcomes.

This is music that makes little money, that\u0026#39;s noisy and exploratory in sound and that\u0026#39;s largely independent from both the market and from traditional high art institutions.

Structured inequality in the nation\u0026#39;s schools is deeply connected to social stratification within American society. This paradox began in the eighteenth century and has proved an enduring legacy. Mark Ryan provides historical, political, and pedagogical contexts for teacher candidates—not only to comprehend the nature of racial segregation but, as future educators, to understand their own professional responsibilities, both in the community and in the school, to strive for an integrated classroom where all children have a chance to succeed. The goal of providing every child a world-class education is an ethical imperative, an inherent necessity for a functioning pluralistic democracy.

Blues-singing lesbians, popularly known as \u0026quot;bulldaggers,\u0026quot; performed bawdy songs; cross-dressing men vied for the top prizes in lavish drag balls; and black and white women flaunted their sexuality in scandalous melodramas and musical revues.

Drawing upon Kantian aesthetic theory as well as case law, legal theory, and constitutional theory, Edlin develops a new conceptual framework for the respective roles of the individual judge and of the judiciary as an institution, as well as the relationship between them, as integral parts of the broader legal and political community. Specifically, Edlin situates a judge\u0026#39;s subjective responses within a form of legal reasoning and reflective judgment that must be communicated to different audiences.\u003cBR /\u003e\u003cBR /\u003e Edlin concludes that the individual values and perspectives of judges are indispensable both to their judgments in specific cases and to the independence of the courts.

The second chapter then looks at the concepts of sekai, \"tradition,\" and shuko, \"innovation.\" Kabuki was the product of material that had become a familiar part of Japanese culture by repeated use and dramatization over long periods of time, starting before kabuki began, and material that was relatively new and was used to transform the older, set material.

The first chapter of Part Two traces the development of Sukeroku's Soga Goro/samurai identity, from its origins in the early dramatic forms of no, kowaka, and ko-joruri, to the representation of Soga Goro in kabuki by Ichikawa Danjuro I.

Despite such horrific aspects, evidence suggests that civil war is likely to generate multilayered outcomes. To examine the transformative aspects of civil war, Mehmet Gurses draws on an original survey conducted in Turkey, where a Kurdish armed group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), has been waging an intermittent insurgency for Kurdish self-rule since 1984. Findings from a probability sample of 2,100 individuals randomly selected from three major Kurdish-populated provinces in the eastern part of Turkey, coupled with insights from face-to-face in-depth interviews with dozens of individuals affected by violence, provide evidence for the multifaceted nature of exposure to violence during civil war. Just as the destructive nature of war manifests itself in various forms and shapes, wartime experiences can engender positive attitudes toward women, create a culture of political activism, and develop secular values at the individual level. In addition, wartime experiences seem to robustly predict greater support for political activism.

This young and maverick poet, whom Nero commanded to commit suicide at the age of 26, left an epic poem on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey that epitomizes the exuberance and stylistic experimentation of Neronian culture. This study focuses on Lucan's epic technique and traces his influence through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\u003c\/P\u003e\u003cP\u003eMartin T. Dinter's newest volume engages with Lucan's use of body imagery, \u003cI\u003esententiae\u003c\/I\u003e, \u003cI\u003eFama\u003c\/I\u003e (rumor), and open-endedness throughout his civil war epic. Although Lucan's \u003cI\u003eBellum Civile\u003c\/I\u003e is frequently decried as a fragmented as well as fragmentary epic, this study demonstrates how Lucan uses devices other than teleology and cohesive narrative structure to bind together the many parts of his epic body. \u003c\/P\u003e\u003cP\u003eAnatomizing \u003cI\u003eCivil War\u003c\/I\u003e places at center stage characteristics of Lucan's work that have so far been interpreted as excessive, or as symptoms of an overly rhetorical culture indicating a lack of substance. By demonstrating that they all contribute to Lucan's poetic technique, Martin T. Dinter shows how they play a fundamental role in shaping and connecting the many episodes of the \u003cI\u003eBellum Civile\u003c\/I\u003e that constitute Lucan's epic body. This important volume will be of interest to students of classics and comparative literature as well as literary scholars.

The book contributes to a more sober evaluation of West German protest movements, not just terrorism, as it refrains from emotional and moral judgments, but takes the protesters\u0026#39; approaches seriously, which, regarding consumer society, had a rational core. Political violence is not presented as the result of individual shortcomings, but emerges in relation to major societal changes, i.e., the unprecedented growth of consumption. This new perspective sheds important light on violence and radical protest in post-war Germany, as previous books have failed to examine to what extent these forms of resistance should be regarded as reactions to changing regimes of provision. Continuing the recently growing interest in the interdependence of countercultures and consumer society, the focus on violence gives the argument a unique twist, making the book thought-provoking and engaging.\u003cDIV\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6713536\"\u003eView on Fulcrum platform.\u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.6713536","language":"eng","modified":"2025-07-20T08:22:54Z","published":"2014-01-01","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","subject":["History:German History","Political Science","German Studies"]},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/2j62s582j/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/2j62s582j/download","type":"application/epub+zip"},{"rel":"http://opds-spec.org/acquisition/open-access","href":"https://www.fulcrum.org/ebooks/gh93h069c/download","type":"application/pdf"}],"images":[{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gb19f678w/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gb19f678w/full/200,/0/default.jpg","width":200,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gb19f678w/full/400,/0/default.jpg","width":400,"type":"image/jpeg"},{"href":"https://www.fulcrum.org//image-service/gb19f678w/full/800,/0/default.jpg","width":800,"type":"image/jpeg"}]}]}
